Ignore all frameworks and certifications found by the researches that are NOT in the list below:\n\nIT Compliance and Certification:\n- DORA\n- SOC 1\n- SOC 2\n- SOC 3\n- ISO 27001\n- ISO 42001\n- HIPAA\n- PCI DSS\n- HITRUST\n- HITRUST AI RMF (HITRUST AI Risk Management Framework)\n- CMMC\n- CCPA\n- GDPR\n- GLBA\n- FISMA\n- MAR/SOX\n- MARS-E\n- NERC\n- NYDFS\n- NIST CSF\n- NIST SP 800-53\n- NIST AI RMF (NIST AI Risk Management Framework)\n- NIST Cybersecurity for IoT\n\nNote: These are the only frameworks and certifications you will evaluate.\n### OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS\n\n#### Analysis Section\n- Analysis Summary: Provide your analysis of the research findings\n- Corrections Required: List any inaccuracies found and needed corrections\n- Verification Process: Document the steps taken to verify information\n\n#### Company Verification\n- Confirm company identity match for:\n  * Company Name: {Company Name}\n  * Domain: {Domain}\n  * LinkedIn: {LinkedIn URL}\n- Indicate confidence level (high/low)\n\n#### Framework Verification\n- Confirmed Frameworks: List only frameworks that:\n  * Are in the authorized framework list\n  * Have been verified as achieved by the company\n  * Are for the company's own compliance (not provided to others)\n  Format: Comma-separated with \"and\" before last item, or \"None Confirmed\"\n\n- Unconfirmed Frameworks: List frameworks that:\n  * Were incorrectly attributed\n  * Cannot be verified with confidence\n  Format: Comma-separated with \"and\" before last item\n\n#### Vendor Verification\n- Confirmed GRC Tools: List verified tools or \"Not Found\"\n- Confirmed Auditors: List verified auditors or \"Not Found\"\n\n### REQUIRED OUTPUT FIELDS\n1. verification_company_name_match: text\n2. verification_domain_match: text\n3. verification_linkedin_match: text\n4. verification_confidence_level: string [\"high\", \"low\"]\n5. analysis_summary: text\n6. analysis_corrections: text\n7. verification_process: text\n8. confirmed_frameworks: text\n9. unconfirmed_frameworks: text\n10. confirmed_auditors: text\n11. confirmed_grc_tools: text\n### EXAMPLE OUTPUT \nYour output should be structure as the following object:\n{\n  \"verification_company_name_match\": \"true\",\n  \"verification_domain_match\": \"false\",\n  \"verification_linkedin_match\": \"true\",\n  \"verification_confidence_level\": \"high\",\n  \"analysis_summary\": \"The company name matches the verification source, but the domain does not fully align with the expected details. LinkedIn profile corroborates company details. Further investigation is needed regarding the domain.\",\n  \"analysis_corrections\": \"Domain mismatch could be due to a recent domain change or alias used. Further verification needed with the domain administrator.\",\n  \"verification_process\": \"The process involved verifying the company name through official sources, checking the domain against company records, and validating LinkedIn profiles for consistency.\",\n  \"confirmed_frameworks\": \"SOC 1, SOC 2, HIPAA, GDPR\",\n  \"unconfirmed_frameworks\": \"ISO 27001, NIST SP 800-53\",\n  \"confirmed_auditors\": \"Deloitte, KPMG\",\n  \"confirmed_grc_tools\": \"RSA Archer, ServiceNow GRC\"\n}\n\n\n### CONFIRMED FRAMEWORK OUTPUT EXAMPLES\n- If the researchers found that the company has achieved ISO 13485, your output for the confirmed_frameworks field will be \"None Confirmed\".  ISO 13485 is NOT an authorized framework. \n- If the researchers found the company has achieved IMS Global CLR, SOC 1 and ISO 17100, your output for the confirmed_frameworks field will be \"SOC 1\".  ISO 17100 and Global CLR are NOT authorized frameworks. \n### IMPORTANT\n- THIS IS CRITICAL - WE WILL DESTORY OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE CUSTOMER IF THIS IS NOT ACCURATE: You must ensure that you are researching the company named {{ $json.company_info.name }}({{ $json.company_info.domain }}) that matches the company found at {{ $json.company_info.social_urls.linked_in }}.   Many companies have similar names and domains.  The company you are researching is called {{ $json.company_info.name }}, has {{ $json.company_info.domain }} as their domain and can be found at this linkedin page: {{ $json.company_info.social_urls.linked_in }}\n  \n- Be aware that GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA and other privacy certifications and frameworks are often mentioned on websites because the company complies with them.  This may not mean they are actually certified to be compliant.  For example, many websites have a cookie acknowledgement that visitors have to acknowledge.  These cookie policies often mention GDPR and CCPA.  Do not confuse this with the actual certification.  \n### ACCURACY STATEMENT\n- You will verify that your ouput is for \n{{ $json.company_info.name }}, who is the same company at this LinkedIn URL: {{ $json.company_info.social_urls.linked_in }}.  If you do not have high confience that the certifications and frameworks that you found in your research (on search engines and other sources) are for this exact company, respond with \"Low Confidence\" \n- If the website does not have a \"Trust Center\" or other sections prooving thier commitment to data security and compliance, then search Google\n-  You MUST document the steps you have taken, specifically any google searches you made\n- If you are taking information from an online source, such as a Press Release, the information in the \"About\" section (or other section that contains the company's contact information) you must verify that the company mentioned is the same EXACT company as our prospect.  \n- ALWAYS CLEAR YOUR CACHE BEFORE SEARCHING.  YOUR JOB DEPENDS ON FRESH INFORMATION\n- Unauthorized frameworks will not be confirmed frameworks.  This is critical.

Each visit is assessed based on page type and framework relevance, to produce a consistent and accurate score.\n\nHere is the data for calculation:\n- Page Visited URL: ${input.page_visited_url}\n- Company Confirmed Frameworks: ${input.company_confirmed_frameworks}\n- Page Visited Summary: ${input.page_visited_summary}\n- Page Visited Frameworks: ${input.page_visited_frameworks}\n\n\nRequired Input Data:\njson\nCopy\n{\n  \"url\": \"string\",\n  \"page_type\": \"string\",\n  \"page_summary\": \"string\",\n  \"framework_focus\": \"string | null\",\n  \"company_frameworks\": \"string[] | null\"\n}\nScoring Process:\nStep 1: Base Score Calculation (0-3)\nEvaluate the page type to assign a base score (0-3). The base score represents the general level of purchasing intent based on the content of the page.\n\nScore 3 (High Intent): Pages that strongly indicate buying intent.\n\nService offering pages\nProduct pages\nPricing pages\nSales contact pages\nFramework certification services\nImplementation services\nConsultation/demo request pages\nScore 2 (Medium Intent): Pages that suggest interest, but with a focus on information or exploration.\n\nCompany pages with detailed information about offerings (e.g., compliance solutions, consulting services, etc.)\nTechnical documentation\nCase studies\nROI calculators\nCertification preparation resources\nScore 1 (Low Intent): Pages that are more informational and not directly tied to purchasing decisions.\n\nBlog posts\nNews articles\nFramework comparisons\nIndustry trends\nGeneral educational content\nAbout us pages\nScore 0 (No Intent): Pages that do not suggest any immediate purchasing interest.\n\nUnclear or irrelevant page types\nStep 2: Framework Context Multiplier (0.8-1.0)\nEvaluate the framework relevance and apply a multiplier based on the page’s alignment with the company’s frameworks.\n\n1.0 Multiplier (Relevant Framework Focus):\nIf the page is focused on a framework the company already uses or may need, apply a 1.0 multiplier.\n\n0.8 Multiplier (Low Relevance):\nIf the page discusses multiple frameworks, or if it’s a framework-agnostic page, apply a 0.8 multiplier. This lower multiplier applies when the company’s frameworks aren’t directly relevant to the page content.\n\nStep 3: Final Score Calculation\nCombine the base score and framework multiplier to determine the final score:\n\nFinal Score = Base Score × Framework Multiplier × 3\n\nThe final score is then classified into three levels of confidence: high, medium, or low, based on the overall certainty about the page’s intent.\n\nOutput Schema:\njson\nCopy\n{\n  \"base_score\": \"number\",  \n  \"framework_multiplier\": \"number\",  \n  \"final_weighted_score\": \"number\",  \n  \"rationale\": \"string\",  \n  \"confidence\": \"number\"\n}\nExample Scenarios and Expected Outputs:\nHigh Intent Example:\n\nInput:\n\njson\nCopy\n{\n  \"url\": \"/soc2-certification-services\",\n  \"page_type\": \"service\",\n  \"page_summary\": \"SOC 2 certification consulting services page\",\n  \"framework_focus\": \"SOC 2\",\n  \"company_frameworks\": [\"ISO 27001\"]\n}\nOutput:\n\njson\nCopy\n{\n  \"base_score\": 3,\n  \"framework_multiplier\": 1.0,\n  \"final_weighted_score\": 9,\n  \"rationale\": \"Service page with SOC 2 focus suggests high intent for certification services, even if SOC 2 is not yet in use by the company.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.9\n}\nMedium Intent Example:\n\nInput:\n\njson\nCopy\n{\n  \"url\": \"/compliance-solutions\",\n  \"page_type\": \"service\",\n  \"page_summary\": \"General compliance solutions page\",\n  \"framework_focus\": \"null\",\n  \"company_frameworks\": [\"ISO 27001\"]\n}\nOutput:\n\njson\nCopy\n{\n  \"base_score\": 2,\n  \"framework_multiplier\": 0.8,\n  \"final_weighted_score\": 4.8,\n  \"rationale\": \"General company page with compliance interest.

Pages like service and product offerings are always high intent (score 3). Pages that are informational in nature (blogs, news, educational content) should have low intent scores (1).\n\nFramework Relevance:\nPages that focus on a framework already used by the company should maintain a multiplier of 1.0, reflecting strong relevance.

Intent Score\n7) Calculate ICP Framework Score\n8) Check if the all diferent score values for all the categories (ICP Location Score, ICP Industry score, ICP Job Title score, ICP Company Size Score, ICP Intent Score, ICP Framework Score) fall into one of the provided valid values for that category in the list bellow: \n- Job Title ICP Valid Scores: 0 or 3 or 6 or 9 or 12\n- Company Size ICP Valid Scores: 0 or 1 or 2 or 3 or 4\n- Intent ICP Valid Scores: 0 or 3 or 6 or 9 or 12 or 15 or 18\n- Framework ICP Valid Scores: 0 or 3 or 6 or 9 or 12\n- Location ICP Valid Scores: 0 or 2 or 8\n- ICP Industry Valid Scores: 0 or 2 or 8\nIf any category dosn't have one of the valid scores provided, re-run the tool that calculates the score for that category.\nExamples:\n-Job title Score is 2 (invalid) but valid values are (0 , 3 , 6 , 9 , 12) so we re-calculate the Job Title Score.\n-Company Size ICP score is 5 (invalid) but valid scores are (0 , 1, 2 ,3 ,4) so we re-calculate the Company ICP Score.\n- Intent ICP score is 7 (invalid) but valid scores are (0,3,6,9,12,15,18) so we re-calculate the Intent ICP Score\n\nStrictly re-calculate up to two times for each category (Job Title, Company Size , Intent, etc.).\n\n9) Take a look at the scores again and if any category doesn't fall into a valid range set it's score to 0.\n10) Calculate the max possible score (maxPossibleScore in the output) using the calculator, this is the sum of all max possibles scores for each category:\n- Job Title Max score: 12\n- Industry Max score: 8\n- Location Max score: 8\n- Company Size Max scor: 4\n- Frameworks Max score: 12\n- Intent Max score: 18\nMax points = 12+8+8+4+12+18 = 62\n11) Calculate total score which is the sum of all the scores we got for each category (totalScore in the output) using the calculator.\nExample \n- Job Title Score: 3\n- Company Size Score: 0\n- Intent Score: 6\n- Framework Score: 9\n- Location Score: 2 (Include Location score in the totalScore sum, only if it's not local (is_local is equal to false), in onther cases act as it's score is 0 (when is_local is equal to false))\n- Industry Score: 2\n\nTotal score is the sum of 3 + 0 + 6 + 9 + 2 + 2  which

The contact hold a Registered Nurse position, reflecting a limited influence on compliance or IT security. The company meets HIPAA compliance and has SOC 1 certifications, indicating attention to security standards, but the contact's role is not aligned with decision-making in compliance or security areas.

They hold important compliance frameworks including NIST Cybersecurity Framework and potentially HITRUST. The contact's role as an Advanced Technology Account Executive suggests limited influence on compliance decisions. The interest shown in HITRUST indicates awareness of compliance frameworks but was represented in a blog context, highlighting a need for additional information.\n--Crocs, a large player in the Apparel & Fashion industry, employs over 5000 personnel. The VP of Digital Commerce demonstrates strong influence over technology strategies but does not directly relate to compliance or security leadership. Crocs has two established compliance frameworks but visited a blog article indicating low intent. Given the company's size and employee count, it should be monitored for potential interest in cybersecurity enhancements.\n\n- Write Job Title score summary (Output: \"job_title_summary\"), it needs to start with score and max possible points\n  Example:  3/12 Points - The title 'Research Specialist' does not match the higher scoring titles in the defined categories which include management or ownership positions in compliance or technical fields.\n- Write Industry score summary (Output: \"industry_summary\") it needs to start with score and max possible points\n  Example: 8/8 Points - The industry is 'Computer Software' which is a target industry for compliance solutions and technology, thus scoring a 4.\n- Write Location score summary (Output: \"location_summary\") it needs to start with score and max possible points\n  Example: 2/8 Points - No specific location is provided, therefore it's unclear if they fall within the 60-mile radius of Philadelphia, so the score defaults to 1.\n- Write Company Size summary (Output: \"company_size_summary\") it needs to start with score and max possible points\n  Example: 4/4 Points - The company has 2,599 employees, which qualifies them for a score of 4 (500+ employees).\n- Write Frameworks score summary (Output: \"frameworks_summary\") it needs to start with score and max possible points\n  Example: 12/15 Points - The company is confirmed to have frameworks ISO 27001 and SOC 2, and they also refer to SOC 2 and PCI DSS in the page visited, yielding a score of 4 for having three or more confirmed frameworks.\n- Write Intent score summary (Output: \"intent_summary\") it needs to start with score and max possible points\n  Example: 3/18 Points - The page visited is a blog article (contains '/blog/') which scores 1, and does not exclusively focus on a single framework applicable to the company, leading to a score of 1 for factor B.\n\n\n\n--- OUTPUT EXAMPLES ----\n{\n\t\"summary\": \"The prospect from Diligent has a role as a Research Specialist within the Computer Software industry, which has a focus on governance.

Partners\n\n## GOAL\nYour goal is to accurately classify companies as either competitors or potential partners of I.S. Partners, while avoiding any incorrect classifications that could lead to business harm. You must protect I.S. Partners from inadvertently marketing to competitors while identifying valuable partnership opportunities.\n\n## ROLE\nYou are a specialized business analyst with expertise in:\n- IT compliance and audit services\n- Competitive analysis\n- Partnership evaluation\n- Service offering assessment\n- Industry classification\n\nYour primary responsibilities are to:\n1. Carefully analyze company descriptions and service offerings\n2. Identify explicit evidence of competitive services\n3. Evaluate partnership potential based on service synergy\n4. Make clear, evidence-based classifications\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for all decisions\n\n## CORE PRINCIPLE\nAccuracy is paramount. An incorrect classification could result in:\n- Sharing sensitive information with competitors\n- Missing valuable partnership opportunities\n- Damaging business relationships\n- Wasting marketing resources\n\n## STRICT EVIDENCE REQUIREMENT - READ FIRST\nA company can ONLY be classified as a competitor if compliance audit services are EXPLICITLY LISTED in their services or specialties.\n\nTo classify as competitor, MUST see phrases like:\n- \"We provide SOC 2 audits\"\n- \"We perform HIPAA certification\"\n- \"Our compliance audit services include...\"\n- \"We offer compliance certification\"\n- \"We provide compliance attestation\"\n\nNEVER:\n- Assume a service exists if not listed\n- Infer competitive services from industry presence\n- Classify as competitor without explicit service listing\n- Make assumptions about potential services\n- Classify based on hypotheticals\n\nIF NO EXPLICIT AUDIT SERVICES ARE LISTED → NOT A COMPETITOR\n\n## ABSOLUTE RULES\n1. NEVER classify based on hypothetical scenarios\n2. NEVER classify based on potential future services\n3. NEVER classify based on industry presence alone\n4. REQUIRE explicit evidence of competitive services\n5. Manufacturing companies are NOT competitors by default\n6. Internal compliance activities are NOT competitive services\n7. Working with auditors does NOT make a company a competitor\n8. Being audited does NOT make a company a competitor\n\n## CRITICAL EVIDENCE REQUIREMENTS\n- Must have clear evidence of providing compliance audit services to be a competitor\n- Must find specific mention of audit/certification services\n- Industry presence or company size does NOT indicate competitive status\n- Being regulated or compliant does NOT make a company a competitor\n- Manufacturing regulated products does NOT make a company a competitor\n- Internal compliance departments do NOT make a company a competitor\n- Working with external auditors does NOT make a company a competitor\n\n## ABOUT THE PROSPECT \nCompany Name:  {{ $json.company_info.name }}\nWebsite: {{ $json.company_info.domain }}\nLinkedIn URL: {{ $json.company_info.social_urls.linked_in }}\nDescription: {{ $json.company_info.report }}\nIndustry: {{ $json.company_info.industry }}\nServices: {{ $json.company_info.products ? $json.company_info.products.join(\",\") : \"\" }}\nSpecialities: {{ $json.company_info.specialities ? $json.company_info.specialities.join(\",\") : \"\" }}\n\n\n## I.S. PARTNERS CORE SERVICES\nI.S. Partners provides IT compliance and audit services, including:\n- SOC Audits (SOC 1, 2, 3, Cybersecurity, Supply Chain)\n- ISO Certifications (27001, 42001, 50001)\n- Compliance Audits (HIPAA/HITECH, PCI DSS, CMMC, CCPA, GDPR)\n- AI Compliance (NIST AI RMF, ISO 42001, HITRUST AI RMF)\n- Cybersecurity Frameworks (NIST CSF, SP 800-53)\n\n## CRITICAL DISTINCTIONS\n\n### WORKING WITH AUDITORS VS BEING AN AUDITOR\nDO NOT CONFUSE:\n- Being audited vs. Performing audits\n- Working with auditors vs. Being an auditor\n- Getting certified vs. Providing certification\n- Having external auditors vs. Being an external auditor\n\nThese phrases indicate a company USES audit services (NOT a competitor):\n- \"Works with external auditors\"\n- \"Validated by third-party auditors\"\n- \"Certified by independent auditors\"\n- \"Undergoes regular audits\"\n- \"Partners with compliance auditors\"\n- \"Verified by external assessors\"\n\nThese phrases indicate a company PROVIDES audit services (IS a competitor):\n- \"We perform audits\"\n- \"Our audit services include\"\n- \"We certify other companies\"\n- \"Our auditors assess\"\n- \"We provide compliance verification\"\n\n### HEALTHCARE TECHNOLOGY VENDORS\nDO NOT CLASSIFY AS COMPETITOR WHEN THEY:\n1. List compliance standards they meet\n2. Mention adhering to multiple frameworks\n3. Describe security certifications they've achieved\n4. Market their solutions as compliant\n5. Work with external auditors\n6. Maintain internal compliance programs\n\nCommon statements that do NOT indicate competitive services:\n- \"Our platform is HIPAA, HITRUST, and SOC 2 compliant\"\n- \"We meet NIST 800-53 requirements\"\n- \"Platform certified for multiple compliance frameworks\"\n- \"Solutions built to healthcare compliance standards\"\n- \"Adherence to HITRUST, SOC-2, and HIPAA standards\"\n- \"Validated by external auditors\"\n\n# PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMS - SPECIAL RULES\n\n## AUTOMATIC COMPETITOR CLASSIFICATION\nPublic accounting and professional services firms that list \"Audit\" services are typically competitors, including:\n- Big 4 firms (Deloitte, EY, KPMG, PwC)\n- National accounting firms\n- Regional accounting firms that provide audit services\n- Professional services firms with audit practices\n\n## KEY INDICATORS OF COMPETITION\nWhen a company is a public accounting or professional services firm AND lists any of:\n- \"Audit services\"\n- \"Attestation services\"\n- \"Assurance services\"\n- \"Advisory services\" (in conjunction with audit)\n\nThey should be classified as competitors because these firms typically provide:\n- SOC audits\n- Compliance certifications\n- IT audit services\n- Security attestations\n\n## EXAMPLES\n\n### Example: Large Accounting Firm\n```\nCompany: Major Accounting LLP\nServices: Audit, Tax, Advisory, Consulting\n\nis_partner: FALSE\nis_competitor: TRUE\ncompetitor_reasoning: As a public accounting firm providing audit services, they compete with I.S. Partners in providing SOC audits and compliance certifications.\n```\n\n### Example: Regional Accounting Firm\n```\nCompany: Regional Accounting Group\nServices: Tax, Business Advisory, Wealth Management\n(Note: No audit services listed)\n\nis_partner: FALSE\nis_competitor: FALSE\npartner_reasoning: While an accounting firm, they do not provide audit services and therefore do not compete with I.S. Partners.\n```\n### FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS - SPECIAL RULES\nFinancial institutions (banks, investment firms, etc.) require special attention:\n\nDO NOT CONFUSE:\n- Internal compliance activities vs. Providing compliance services\n- Having a compliance department vs. Offering compliance audits\n- Risk management operations vs. Compliance certification services\n- Regulatory reporting vs. Compliance auditing\n- Sanctions screening vs. Compliance assessments\n- Internal audit functions vs. External audit services\n\nCommon financial institution activities that are NOT competitive services:\n- Internal compliance programs\n- Risk management departments\n- Regulatory reporting\n- Sanctions screening\n- KYC/AML processes\n- Internal audits\n- Vendor risk assessments\n- Regulatory filings\n- Due diligence reviews\n\n### MANUFACTURING COMPANIES - SPECIAL RULES\nManufacturing companies, including:\n- Medical device manufacturers\n- Healthcare equipment producers\n- Hardware manufacturers\n- Pharmaceutical companies\n- Industrial equipment makers\n\nAre automatically NOT competitors unless there is explicit evidence they provide compliance audit services to other companies. Their status as manufacturers in regulated industries does NOT make them competitors.\n\n### BEING COMPLIANT VS. PROVIDING COMPLIANCE SERVICES\nA company stating they are compliant with standards is COMPLETELY DIFFERENT from providing compliance services.\n\nDO NOT CONFUSE:\n- Having certifications vs. Providing certifications\n- Being compliant vs. Making others compliant\n- Meeting standards vs. Auditing standards\n- Supporting compliance vs. Auditing compliance\n- Implementing compliant solutions vs. Certifying compliance\n- Manufacturing compliant products vs. Providing compliance audits\n\n### COMPLIANCE KEYWORDS ANALYSIS\n\nTHESE WORDS/PHRASES ALONE DO NOT INDICATE A COMPETITOR:\n- \"Compliant with...\"\n- \"Certified by...\"\n- \"Meets requirements of...\"\n- \"Built to standards of...\"\n- \"Adheres to...\"\n- \"In compliance with...\"\n- \"Achieved certification in...\"\n- \"Compliance support\"\n- \"Compliance implementation\"\n- \"Compliance preparation\"\n- \"Helps achieve compliance\"\n- \"FDA-compliant products\"\n- \"Regulated medical devices\"\n- \"HIPAA-compliant solutions\"\n- \"Internal audit team\"\n- \"Compliance department\"\n- \"Risk management\"\n- \"Regulatory reporting\"\n- \"Sanctions screening\"\n- \"KYC/AML processes\"\n- \"Due diligence\"\n- \"Vendor assessment\"\n- \"Regulatory compliance\"\n- \"Banking compliance\"\n\nTHESE WORDS/PHRASES INDICATE A COMPETITOR:\n- \"We certify...\"\n- \"We audit...\"\n- \"We assess compliance...\"\n- \"Provide certification services...\"\n- \"Compliance auditing...\"\n- \"We validate compliance...\"\n- \"Attestation services...\"\n- \"We verify compliance...\"\n- \"Compliance verification services\"\n- \"We perform compliance audits\"\n- \"Certification authority\"\n- \"Authorized compliance assessor\"\n\n## CLASSIFICATION RULES\n\n### IMMEDIATE DISQUALIFIERS\n- Any organization with .edu or .gov domain → DO NOT CLASSIFY\n- Any organization providing IT compliance audits or certifications → COMPETITOR\n- Organizations with no meaningful connection to IT, security, or compliance → NOT PARTNER\n- Manufacturing companies without audit services → NOT COMPETITOR\n- Financial institutions with only internal compliance → NOT COMPETITOR\n\n### COMPETITOR IDENTIFICATION\nA company is ONLY a competitor if they EXPLICITLY list services that:\n- Provide compliance audit/certification services to other companies\n- Market themselves as compliance auditors\n- Offer formal IT compliance assessments to external clients\n\nMust see these services clearly listed - no assumptions or hypotheticals.\n\n### PARTNER IDENTIFICATION\nA company must meet at least ONE of these criteria to be classified as a PARTNER:\n\n1. Direct Service Complementarity:\n   - Provides compliance readiness or preparation services\n   - Offers cybersecurity implementation or consulting\n   - Provides GRC software platforms\n   - Delivers IT security services or solutions\n   - Implements industry-specific compliant solutions\n\n2. Strong Industry Alignment:\n   - Focus on IT security or risk management\n   - Specializes in regulatory technology\n   - Provides managed security services\n   - Offers data protection solutions\n   - Delivers regulated industry solutions\n\n3. Clear Value Chain Connection:\n   - Services naturally lead to compliance needs\n   - Works with clients likely to need compliance audits\n   - Provides solutions that require compliance validation\n   - Offers complementary risk management services\n\nNOT sufficient for partnership alone:\n- Simply being in the technology sector\n- Having achieved compliance certifications\n- Occasional overlap in client base\n- Basic IT services without security focus\n- Hardware manufacturing, even for regulated industries\n- Being subject to compliance requirements\n- Having internal compliance programs\n- Performing internal audits\n\n## EXAMPLE ANALYSES\n\n### Example 1: Healthcare Technology Provider\n```\nServices Listed:\n- Real-Time Care Intelligence\n- Care coordination\n- Risk reduction\n- Prescription monitoring\n- Behavioral Health\n- Crisis Management\n\nis_partner: TRUE\nis_competitor: FALSE\npartner_reasoning: Provides healthcare technology solutions that require compliance validation. No audit services explicitly listed.\ncompetitor_reasoning: N/A\n```\n\n### Example 2: Clear Competitor\n```\nServices Listed:\n- SOC 2 Audit Services\n- HIPAA Compliance Certification\n- ISO 27001 Assessments\n\nis_partner: FALSE\nis_competitor: TRUE\npartner_reasoning: N/A\ncompetitor_reasoning: Explicitly lists compliance audit and certification services that compete with I.S. Partners' offerings.\n```\n\n### Example 3: Medical Device Manufacturer\n```\nCompany: MedDevice Corp\nServices: Medical device manufacturing, FDA-compliant products, healthcare equipment\n\nis_partner: FALSE\nis_competitor: FALSE\npartner_reasoning: Manufacturing medical devices, even in a regulated industry, does not create sufficient service synergy for partnership.\ncompetitor_reasoning: N/A\n```\n\n### Example 4: Large Financial Institution\n```\nCompany: Global Bank Corp\nServices: Commercial banking, investment services, risk management, internal compliance\n\nis_partner: FALSE\nis_competitor: FALSE\npartner_reasoning: While operating in financial services with robust internal compliance, they do not provide complementary services that create partnership opportunities. Their focus is on banking services, not IT or security solutions.\ncompetitor_reasoning: N/A\n```\n\n### Example 5: Financial Technology Provider\n```\nCompany: FinTech Solutions Inc\nServices: Payment processing, banking software, regulatory reporting tools\n\nis_partner: TRUE\nis_competitor: FALSE\npartner_reasoning: Provides financial technology solutions that require compliance validation and creates natural partnership opportunities through clients needing compliance audits.\ncompetitor_reasoning: N/A\n```\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT\nFor each company analyzed, provide these specific fields:\n\nis_partner: [TRUE/FALSE]\nis_competitor: [TRUE/FALSE]\npartner_reasoning: [Detailed explanation if marked as partner, or \"N/A\" if not]\ncompetitor_reasoning: [Detailed explanation if marked as competitor, or \"N/A\" if not]\n","hasOutputParser":true,"options":{}},"type":"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent","typeVersion":1.7,"position":[14280,640],"id":"345f8795-8646-489d-8e76-03bb253367c7","name":"Competitor/Partner Classification","retryOnFail":true,"onError":"continueRegularOutput"},{"parameters":{"model":{"__rl":true,"mode":"list","value":"gpt-4o-mini"},"options":{"maxRetries":10}},"type":"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmChatOpenAi","typeVersion":1.2,"position":[14260,860],"id":"d7cf628a-3d07-4df5-a933-7c573ebb629a","name":"Competitor/Partner Classification Model","credentials":{"openAiApi":{"id":"mzHalaHzUD5jrTet","name":"searchactions.com: ispartnersllc.com - Website Visitor Enrichmen"}}},{"parameters":{"jsonSchemaExample":"{\n\t\"is_partner\": \"TRUE\",\n\t\"is_competitor\": \"FALSE\",\n    \"partner_reasoning\":\"\",\n    \"competitor_reasoning\":\"\"\n}"},"type":"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputParserStructured","typeVersion":1.2,"position":[14480,860],"id":"ae1387be-253f-4645-a3aa-bee469e09392","name":"Competitor/Partner Parser"},{"parameters":{"mode":"runOnceForEachItem","jsCode":"let original = $('Combining Contact non-public information').item.json\nconst object = {\n  is_partner: $json?.output?.is_partner || \"\",\n  is_competitor: $json?.output?.is_competitor || \"\",\n  partner_reasoning: $json?.output?.partner_reasoning || \"\",\n  competitor_reasoning: $json?.output?.competitor_reasoning || \"\"\n}\n\noriginal.company_info.competitor_partner_classification = object\nreturn original"},"type":"n8n-nodes-base.code","typeVersion":2,"position":[14640,640],"id":"32af7565-a124-4122-ab6e-01cbad3b17e0","name":"Adding Competitor Partner Classification"},{"parameters":{"promptType":"define","text":"=# AUTHORIZED FRAMEWORKS\nOnly these exact frameworks and certifications are authorized.

The goal of this task is to write a two sentence bridge that connects the existing opening line of the email to a specific compliance problem and the pain that problem causes the business.  The two  sentences will be short and direct, with a clear cause and effect between them.\n\n# Writing Guidelines\n\n## Core Style Elements\n* Write at a 4th grade reading level\n* Use natural, conversational language\n* Keep sentences short and direct\n* Use casual abbreviations (b/c, w/, +)\n* Be confident and precise\n* OK to use exclamation points and occasional caps for emphasis\n\n## Language Do's and Don'ts\n\n### DO:\n* Use specific industry terms\n* If the specific frameworks that have are mentioned in the opening line, don't mention them all by name again.  For example, if the opening line says \"I noticed [[company name]] already has SOC 1, SOC 2, PCI DSS...\" then your bridge will refer to these frameworks as \"these frameworks\". \n* Mention team size when relevant\n* Use confident language when speaking about facts (\"means\", \"requires\", \"brings\")\n* Use less confident language when you are unsure (\"could\", \"may\", \"possibly\")\n* Use neutral terms (\"spent on\", \"dedicated to\", \"needed for\")\n* Be specific (\"security requirements\", \"data protection controls\", \"SOC 2 controls\", etc)\n* Prioritize aligning the problem in sentence 1 with the pain it causes in sentence 2.  There must be a direct connection.  This is critical.\n* If the opening line states that  {{ $json.company_info.name }} has ISO 27001 and SOC 2 frameworks, you will speak to the benefits of mapping ISO 27001 and SOC 2 controls:  Identify overlapping controls, removing redundant work and cutting down the time required from your team.   \n\n### DON'T:\n* Use corporate jargon or buzzwords\n* Show uncertainty (\"might\", \"could\", \"maybe\") UNLESS the fact you are stating is subjective, unknown or depends on other factors or variables that are not known.\n* Use negative language (\"lost to\", \"waste\", \"burden\")\n* Be vague (\"compliance rules\", \"extra requirements\")\n* Use emojis\n* Be overly enthusiastic\n* Use unnecessary adjectives\n* Use \"I think...\" statements\n* Make up information\n\n## Examples\n\nWRONG:\n```\n\"I'm reaching out b/c the new partnership might bring extra compliance rules your small team has to follow.\"\n- Uses uncertainty (\"might\")\n- Vague (\"extra compliance rules\")\n- Generic language\n```\n\nRIGHT:\n```\n\"I'm reaching out b/c partnering with institutional data providers means new security requirements to manage.\"\n- Confident (\"means\")\n- Specific (\"security requirements\")\n- Industry-relevant (\"institutional data\")\n```\n\n\n# Format\nTwo sentence bridge that follows this opening line in the email: {{ $json.personalization.sentence_opening }}\n# Required Input\n* First sentence (Personalized Opener): {{ $json.personalization.sentence_opening }}\n* Company name: {{ $json.company_info.name }}\n* Industry: {{ $json.company_info.industry }}\n* Company description/what they do: {{ $json.company_info.report }}\n* Frameworks they have (if known): {{ $json.company_info.framework_review.confirmed_frameworks_primary }}\n* News article summary (if exists): {{ $json.company_info.positive_article.summary }}\n* Type of news: {{ $json.company_info.positive_article.category }}\n* Impact on employees: {{ $json.company_info.positive_article.employee_reaction }}\n* Impact on community: {{ $json.company_info.positive_article.local_impact }}\n* Size of company: {{ $json.company_info.size }}\n* Latest round of funding: {{ $json.company_info.funding.latest_round_year }}\n* Amount of latest round of funding: {{ $json.company_info.funding.latest_round_amount }}\n\n# Pain Points to Include (Use One)\n* Time costs (specific hours per week/month/quarter)\n* Resource requirements (specific team members needed)\n* Revenue impact (delays in deals/partnerships)\n* Team burden (specific tasks/documentation requirements)\n* Compliance costs (audit preparation, certification costs)\n\n# Example Outputs By Scenario\n\n## Has News + No Framework:\n```\nFirst Line: \"I did some research on [[company name]] and saw an article about your acceptance of Medicaid - love seeing how you're making therapy more accessible.\"\n\nBridge Output:\nSentence one: \"I'm reaching out b/c accepting Medicaid means new rules to protect patient info.\"\nSentence two: \"This means your team could spend a ton of time each month just documenting HIPAA procedures and prepping for audits.\"\n```\n\n## Has News + Has Framework:\n```\nFirst Line: \"I saw [[company name]] acquired StarCite - great move!\"\n\nBridge Output:\nSentence one: \"I'm reaching out b/c mergers mean bringing different compliance programs together. \nSentence two: \"Most companies spend 3-4 months aligning their SOC 2 controls after an acquisition.\"\n```\n\n## No News + Has Framework:\n```\nFirst Line: \"I noticed you already have SOC 2 in place - smart move!\"\n\nBridge Output:\nSentence one: \"I'm reaching out b/c maintaining SOC 2 takes up a ton of dev time.\"\nSentence two: \"Most teams spend 40+ hours each quarter just gathering evidence and preparing for audits.\"\n```\n\n## No News + No Framework:\n```\nFirst Line: \"I noticed [[company name]] helps investment managers make better decisions - that's important work!\"\n\nBridge Output:\nSentence one: \"I'm reaching out b/c fintech companies need strong security to win those big enterprise clients. Sentence two: \"Most companies take 4-6 months to get compliant, which delays deals.\"\n```\n\n## IMPORTANT - Has ISO 27001 and SOC 2 Frameworks:\nIf the company has ISO 27001 and SOC 2 frameworks, you will ignore the news and use focus on the time and complexity required for mapping controls between these two frameworks.  \n```\nFirst Line: \"I did some research on [[company name]] and see you have SOC 2 & ISO 27001 - great move!\"\n\nBridge Output:\nSentence one: \"I'm reaching out because I know mapping controls between them is a pain - not to mention time consuming.   \nSentence two: \"Most companies spend several months aligning controls like incident response, access management, and encryption to meet both frameworks' requirements.\"\n```\n\n# Key Elements\n* Keep language simple and direct\n* Sound like a real person having a conversation\n* Connect directly to their news/situation or compliance framework(s) when possible\n* Include one specific, measurable pain point\n\n* Make the pain point relevant to their industry and size\n* Sentence 1 - Problem\n* Sentence 2 - Pain point directly related to problem\n* Sentence 1 and Sentence 2 MUST align.\n# Output\n- Write two sentences. \n-- Sentence one will be inserted into the field labeled \"bridge_sentence_1\".  \n-- Sentence two will be inserted into the field labeled \"bridge_sentence_2\".\n- Do not include an explanation, analysis or any other text except for the sentences\n# Important\n- Write at a 4th grade level using simple words and a friendly casual tone that mimics human conversation.\n- You write short, concise and direct sentences that are friendly, helpful and convincing without being false or untruthful\n- The bridge sentences you write will come after this opening line:  {{ $json.personalization.sentence_opening }}\n- The key is making sure the second sentence explains the specific pain of the problem mentioned in the first sentence.

Review Prospect Info:\n- Core business/mission\n- Industry focus\n- Size/scale\n- Frameworks they have\n- Recent news (if any)\n\n2. Check Email Elements:\n- Do not include a greeting in the opening line. \n- Opening line should use the \"Why you, why now\" framework.  \"Why I'm reaching out to you, right now\" so that it's clear to the recipient up front why I'm reaching out\"\n- Bridge sentence 1\n- Bridge sentence 2\n- How we can help\n- Related customers (social proof)\n- Closing (call to action)\n\n3. Identify Issues:\n- Disconnected elements\n- Technical overload\n- Missed business connections\n- Tone inconsistencies\n- Redundant information\n\n## Improvement Guidelines\n* Write at a 4th grade reading level using simple words and short sentences\n* Use natural, conversational language that mimics a human, but keep the sentences short - one sentence to a line.\n* Keep sentences short and direct\n* Connect to their core business\n* Avoid listing multiple frameworks repeatedly\n* Make compliance relevant to their goals\n* Use casual abbreviations (b/c, w/, +) but don't overdo it\n* Maintain consistent tone throughout\n* Avoid jargon and colorful verbs and adjectives\n*  Avoid jargon and overly technical terms unless they are relevant to the recipient's field.\n* Do not insert related customers into any other sentence except for the \"Related Customers\" sentence and do not change the \"Related Customers\" sentence we've provided to you.   Here is that sentence:  \n{{ $json.personalization.related_customers_sentence }}\n* You will only write one sentence for each part.

In this situation, choose the framework that you believe the person is most interested in.  ${input.company_info.name};s current frameworks/certifications that they have, if they have any.  \n\n<OUTPUT>\nYour output will have two parts.   The first part will be the main framework you chose.   The second part will be the benefit sentence related to that framework.  Do not explain your answer or add any additional words to the output.    For example, if the framework/certification is SOC 1, your output will be:  Keep your clients' money safe, land those big company deals, and get your books in perfect shape.\n\nIf the page is about SOC 1 and SOC 2, and you are unable to choose the best framework, you can respond with the SOC 1 & 2 Benefits, which combine SOC 1 and SOC 2 benefits. \n\nIf you are unable to determine a framework/certification, then your output should be \"Unable to determine\" \n\nThe benefit sentence will be inserted into the \"benefit_sentence\" field.   The framework you choose will be inserted into the \"benefit_framework\" field. \n\nFor example, if HITRUST is the framework the person was interested in, then you would insert the \"Land bigger healthcare deals, nail multiple security checks at once, and make your security way simpler.\n\"  into the \"benefits_sentence\" field and \"HITRUST\" into the \"benefit_framework\".  \n\nFor example, if NIST AI RMF is the framework, then you will insert \"Get federal contracts rolling in, nail multiple security requirements, and stay ahead of new threats.\n\"  into the \"benefits_sentence\" field and \"NIST AI RMF\" into the \"benefit_framework\".  \n\n<IMPORTANT>\nDo not include the word \"Benefits\" in the \"benefit_framework\" output.  The \"benefit_framework\" will be the framework/certification.  It should not include the word \"benefits\".","hasOutputParser":true,"options":{}},"type":"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent","typeVersion":1.7,"position":[30340,620],"id":"7efcd926-5fd7-48ad-8e57-c873ed1d567f","name":"Content Benefit","retryOnFail":true,"onError":"continueRegularOutput"},{"parameters":{"mode":"runOnceForEachItem","jsCode":"let PrimaryFrameworks = [];\nif ($json.company_info.framework_review.confirmed_frameworks_primary && $json.company_info.framework_review.confirmed_frameworks_primary !== \"Not Found\") {\n  PrimaryFrameworks = $json.company_info.framework_review.confirmed_frameworks_primary.split(\",\");\n  PrimaryFrameworks = PrimaryFrameworks.map(framework => framework.trim());\n}\n\n\nconst data = {\n  \"Phone (Contact)\":$json.user_info.phone_number,\n  \"Email (Contact)\":$json.user_info.primary_email,\n  \"LinkedIn Profile URL\":$json.user_info.social_urls.linked_in,\n  \"Job Title\":$json.user_info.role,\n  \"Job Challenges\":$json.user_info.job_challenges,\n  \"Job Responsibilities\":$json.user_info.job_responsibilities,\n  \"Job Title Normalized\":$json.user_info.role_normalized,\n  \"Picture\":$json.user_info.profile_pick,\n  \"About Contact\":$json.user_info.report,\n  \"ICP - Contact Score\":\"\",\n  \"ICP - Contact Tier\":\"\",\n  \"Industry\":$json.company_info.industry,\n  \"ICP - Company Score\":`${$json.company_info.icp_score.overall_score.totalScore}/${$json.company_info.icp_score.overall_score.maxPossibleScore}`,\n  \"ICP - Company Tier\": $json.company_info.icp_score.total_score_string,\n  \"Company Name\": $json.company_info.name,\n  \"Years in Business\":$json.company_info.years_in_business,\n  \"Company Name - Normalized\":$json.company_info.name_normalized,\n  \"Employee Count\": $json.company_info.size,\n  \"About Company\": $json.company_info.report,\n  \"Compliance - Primary Frameworks\":PrimaryFrameworks,\n  \"Compliance - Secondary Frameworks\":$json.company_info.framework_review.confirmed_frameworks_secondary,\n  \"Auditors\":$json.company_info.framework_review.confirmed_auditors,\n  \"GRC Software\":$json.company_info.framework_review.confirmed_grc_tools,\n  \"Competitor\":$json.company_info.competitor_partner_classification.is_competitor === \"FALSE\" ?
