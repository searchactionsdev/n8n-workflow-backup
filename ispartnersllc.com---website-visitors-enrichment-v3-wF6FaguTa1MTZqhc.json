Ignore all frameworks and certifications found by the researches that are NOT in the list below:\n\nIT Compliance and Certification:\n- DORA\n- SOC 1\n- SOC 2\n- SOC 3\n- ISO 27001\n- ISO 42001\n- HIPAA\n- PCI DSS\n- HITRUST\n- HITRUST AI RMF (HITRUST AI Risk Management Framework)\n- CMMC\n- CCPA\n- GDPR\n- GLBA\n- FISMA\n- MAR/SOX\n- MARS-E\n- NERC\n- NYDFS\n- NIST CSF\n- NIST SP 800-53\n- NIST AI RMF (NIST AI Risk Management Framework)\n- NIST Cybersecurity for IoT\n\nNote: These are the only frameworks and certifications you will evaluate.\n### OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS\n\n#### Analysis Section\n- Analysis Summary: Provide your analysis of the research findings\n- Corrections Required: List any inaccuracies found and needed corrections\n- Verification Process: Document the steps taken to verify information\n\n#### Company Verification\n- Confirm company identity match for:\n  * Company Name: {Company Name}\n  * Domain: {Domain}\n  * LinkedIn: {LinkedIn URL}\n- Indicate confidence level (high/low)\n\n#### Framework Verification\n- Confirmed Frameworks: List only frameworks that:\n  * Are in the authorized framework list\n  * Have been verified as achieved by the company\n  * Are for the company's own compliance (not provided to others)\n  Format: Comma-separated with \"and\" before last item, or \"None Confirmed\"\n\n- Unconfirmed Frameworks: List frameworks that:\n  * Were incorrectly attributed\n  * Cannot be verified with confidence\n  Format: Comma-separated with \"and\" before last item\n\n#### Vendor Verification\n- Confirmed GRC Tools: List verified tools or \"Not Found\"\n- Confirmed Auditors: List verified auditors or \"Not Found\"\n\n### REQUIRED OUTPUT FIELDS\n1. verification_company_name_match: text\n2. verification_domain_match: text\n3. verification_linkedin_match: text\n4. verification_confidence_level: string [\"high\", \"low\"]\n5. analysis_summary: text\n6. analysis_corrections: text\n7. verification_process: text\n8. confirmed_frameworks: text\n9. unconfirmed_frameworks: text\n10. confirmed_auditors: text\n11. confirmed_grc_tools: text\n### EXAMPLE OUTPUT \nYour output should be structure as the following object:\n{\n  \"verification_company_name_match\": \"true\",\n  \"verification_domain_match\": \"false\",\n  \"verification_linkedin_match\": \"true\",\n  \"verification_confidence_level\": \"high\",\n  \"analysis_summary\": \"The company name matches the verification source, but the domain does not fully align with the expected details. LinkedIn profile corroborates company details. Further investigation is needed regarding the domain.\",\n  \"analysis_corrections\": \"Domain mismatch could be due to a recent domain change or alias used. Further verification needed with the domain administrator.\",\n  \"verification_process\": \"The process involved verifying the company name through official sources, checking the domain against company records, and validating LinkedIn profiles for consistency.\",\n  \"confirmed_frameworks\": \"SOC 1, SOC 2, HIPAA, GDPR\",\n  \"unconfirmed_frameworks\": \"ISO 27001, NIST SP 800-53\",\n  \"confirmed_auditors\": \"Deloitte, KPMG\",\n  \"confirmed_grc_tools\": \"RSA Archer, ServiceNow GRC\"\n}\n\n\n### CONFIRMED FRAMEWORK OUTPUT EXAMPLES\n- If the researchers found that the company has achieved ISO 13485, your output for the confirmed_frameworks field will be \"None Confirmed\".  ISO 13485 is NOT an authorized framework. \n- If the researchers found the company has achieved IMS Global CLR, SOC 1 and ISO 17100, your output for the confirmed_frameworks field will be \"SOC 1\".  ISO 17100 and Global CLR are NOT authorized frameworks. \n### IMPORTANT\n- THIS IS CRITICAL - WE WILL DESTORY OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE CUSTOMER IF THIS IS NOT ACCURATE: You must ensure that you are researching the company named {{ $json.company_info.name }}({{ $json.company_info.domain }}) that matches the company found at {{ $json.company_info.social_urls.linked_in }}.   Many companies have similar names and domains.  The company you are researching is called {{ $json.company_info.name }}, has {{ $json.company_info.domain }} as their domain and can be found at this linkedin page: {{ $json.company_info.social_urls.linked_in }}\n  \n- Be aware that GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA and other privacy certifications and frameworks are often mentioned on websites because the company complies with them.  This may not mean they are actually certified to be compliant.  For example, many websites have a cookie acknowledgement that visitors have to acknowledge.  These cookie policies often mention GDPR and CCPA.  Do not confuse this with the actual certification.  \n### ACCURACY STATEMENT\n- You will verify that your ouput is for \n{{ $json.company_info.name }}, who is the same company at this LinkedIn URL: {{ $json.company_info.social_urls.linked_in }}.  If you do not have high confience that the certifications and frameworks that you found in your research (on search engines and other sources) are for this exact company, respond with \"Low Confidence\" \n- If the website does not have a \"Trust Center\" or other sections prooving thier commitment to data security and compliance, then search Google\n-  You MUST document the steps you have taken, specifically any google searches you made\n- If you are taking information from an online source, such as a Press Release, the information in the \"About\" section (or other section that contains the company's contact information) you must verify that the company mentioned is the same EXACT company as our prospect.  \n- ALWAYS CLEAR YOUR CACHE BEFORE SEARCHING.  YOUR JOB DEPENDS ON FRESH INFORMATION\n- Unauthorized frameworks will not be confirmed frameworks.  This is critical.

Each visit is assessed based on page type and framework relevance, to produce a consistent and accurate score.\n\nHere is the data for calculation:\n- Page Visited URL: ${input.page_visited_url}\n- Company Confirmed Frameworks: ${input.company_confirmed_frameworks}\n- Page Visited Summary: ${input.page_visited_summary}\n- Page Visited Frameworks: ${input.page_visited_frameworks}\n\n\nRequired Input Data:\njson\nCopy\n{\n  \"url\": \"string\",\n  \"page_type\": \"string\",\n  \"page_summary\": \"string\",\n  \"framework_focus\": \"string | null\",\n  \"company_frameworks\": \"string[] | null\"\n}\nScoring Process:\nStep 1: Base Score Calculation (0-3)\nEvaluate the page type to assign a base score (0-3). The base score represents the general level of purchasing intent based on the content of the page.\n\nScore 3 (High Intent): Pages that strongly indicate buying intent.\n\nService offering pages\nProduct pages\nPricing pages\nSales contact pages\nFramework certification services\nImplementation services\nConsultation/demo request pages\nScore 2 (Medium Intent): Pages that suggest interest, but with a focus on information or exploration.\n\nCompany pages with detailed information about offerings (e.g., compliance solutions, consulting services, etc.)\nTechnical documentation\nCase studies\nROI calculators\nCertification preparation resources\nScore 1 (Low Intent): Pages that are more informational and not directly tied to purchasing decisions.\n\nBlog posts\nNews articles\nFramework comparisons\nIndustry trends\nGeneral educational content\nAbout us pages\nScore 0 (No Intent): Pages that do not suggest any immediate purchasing interest.\n\nUnclear or irrelevant page types\nStep 2: Framework Context Multiplier (0.8-1.0)\nEvaluate the framework relevance and apply a multiplier based on the page’s alignment with the company’s frameworks.\n\n1.0 Multiplier (Relevant Framework Focus):\nIf the page is focused on a framework the company already uses or may need, apply a 1.0 multiplier.\n\n0.8 Multiplier (Low Relevance):\nIf the page discusses multiple frameworks, or if it’s a framework-agnostic page, apply a 0.8 multiplier. This lower multiplier applies when the company’s frameworks aren’t directly relevant to the page content.\n\nStep 3: Final Score Calculation\nCombine the base score and framework multiplier to determine the final score:\n\nFinal Score = Base Score × Framework Multiplier × 3\n\nThe final score is then classified into three levels of confidence: high, medium, or low, based on the overall certainty about the page’s intent.\n\nOutput Schema:\njson\nCopy\n{\n  \"base_score\": \"number\",  \n  \"framework_multiplier\": \"number\",  \n  \"final_weighted_score\": \"number\",  \n  \"rationale\": \"string\",  \n  \"confidence\": \"number\"\n}\nExample Scenarios and Expected Outputs:\nHigh Intent Example:\n\nInput:\n\njson\nCopy\n{\n  \"url\": \"/soc2-certification-services\",\n  \"page_type\": \"service\",\n  \"page_summary\": \"SOC 2 certification consulting services page\",\n  \"framework_focus\": \"SOC 2\",\n  \"company_frameworks\": [\"ISO 27001\"]\n}\nOutput:\n\njson\nCopy\n{\n  \"base_score\": 3,\n  \"framework_multiplier\": 1.0,\n  \"final_weighted_score\": 9,\n  \"rationale\": \"Service page with SOC 2 focus suggests high intent for certification services, even if SOC 2 is not yet in use by the company.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.9\n}\nMedium Intent Example:\n\nInput:\n\njson\nCopy\n{\n  \"url\": \"/compliance-solutions\",\n  \"page_type\": \"service\",\n  \"page_summary\": \"General compliance solutions page\",\n  \"framework_focus\": \"null\",\n  \"company_frameworks\": [\"ISO 27001\"]\n}\nOutput:\n\njson\nCopy\n{\n  \"base_score\": 2,\n  \"framework_multiplier\": 0.8,\n  \"final_weighted_score\": 4.8,\n  \"rationale\": \"General company page with compliance interest.

Pages like service and product offerings are always high intent (score 3). Pages that are informational in nature (blogs, news, educational content) should have low intent scores (1).\n\nFramework Relevance:\nPages that focus on a framework already used by the company should maintain a multiplier of 1.0, reflecting strong relevance.

Updates"},{"parameters":{"promptType":"define","text":"=# Company Classification Prompt for I.S. Partners\n\n## GOAL\nYour goal is to accurately classify companies as either competitors or potential partners of I.S. Partners, while avoiding any incorrect classifications that could lead to business harm. You must protect I.S. Partners from inadvertently marketing to competitors while identifying valuable partnership opportunities.\n\n## ROLE\nYou are a specialized business analyst with expertise in:\n- IT compliance and audit services\n- Competitive analysis\n- Partnership evaluation\n- Service offering assessment\n- Industry classification\n\nYour primary responsibilities are to:\n1. Carefully analyze company descriptions and service offerings\n2. Identify explicit evidence of competitive services\n3. Evaluate partnership potential based on service synergy\n4. Make clear, evidence-based classifications\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for all decisions\n\n## CORE PRINCIPLE\nAccuracy is paramount. An incorrect classification could result in:\n- Sharing sensitive information with competitors\n- Missing valuable partnership opportunities\n- Damaging business relationships\n- Wasting marketing resources\n\n## STRICT EVIDENCE REQUIREMENT - READ FIRST\nA company can ONLY be classified as a competitor if compliance audit services are EXPLICITLY LISTED in their services or specialties.\n\nTo classify as competitor, MUST see phrases like:\n- \"We provide SOC 2 audits\"\n- \"We perform HIPAA certification\"\n- \"Our compliance audit services include...\"\n- \"We offer compliance certification\"\n- \"We provide compliance attestation\"\n\nNEVER:\n- Assume a service exists if not listed\n- Infer competitive services from industry presence\n- Classify as competitor without explicit service listing\n- Make assumptions about potential services\n- Classify based on hypotheticals\n\nIF NO EXPLICIT AUDIT SERVICES ARE LISTED → NOT A COMPETITOR\n\n## ABSOLUTE RULES\n1. NEVER classify based on hypothetical scenarios\n2. NEVER classify based on potential future services\n3. NEVER classify based on industry presence alone\n4. REQUIRE explicit evidence of competitive services\n5. Manufacturing companies are NOT competitors by default\n6. Internal compliance activities are NOT competitive services\n7. Working with auditors does NOT make a company a competitor\n8. Being audited does NOT make a company a competitor\n\n## CRITICAL EVIDENCE REQUIREMENTS\n- Must have clear evidence of providing compliance audit services to be a competitor\n- Must find specific mention of audit/certification services\n- Industry presence or company size does NOT indicate competitive status\n- Being regulated or compliant does NOT make a company a competitor\n- Manufacturing regulated products does NOT make a company a competitor\n- Internal compliance departments do NOT make a company a competitor\n- Working with external auditors does NOT make a company a competitor\n\n## ABOUT THE PROSPECT \nCompany Name:  {{ $json.company_info.name }}\nWebsite: {{ $json.company_info.domain }}\nLinkedIn URL: {{ $json.company_info.social_urls.linked_in }}\nDescription: {{ $json.company_info.report }}\nIndustry: {{ $json.company_info.industry }}\nServices: {{ $json.company_info.products ? $json.company_info.products.join(\",\") : \"\" }}\nSpecialities: {{ $json.company_info.specialities ? $json.company_info.specialities.join(\",\") : \"\" }}\n\n\n## I.S. PARTNERS CORE SERVICES\nI.S. Partners provides IT compliance and audit services, including:\n- SOC Audits (SOC 1, 2, 3, Cybersecurity, Supply Chain)\n- ISO Certifications (27001, 42001, 50001)\n- Compliance Audits (HIPAA/HITECH, PCI DSS, CMMC, CCPA, GDPR)\n- AI Compliance (NIST AI RMF, ISO 42001, HITRUST AI RMF)\n- Cybersecurity Frameworks (NIST CSF, SP 800-53)\n\n## CRITICAL DISTINCTIONS\n\n### WORKING WITH AUDITORS VS BEING AN AUDITOR\nDO NOT CONFUSE:\n- Being audited vs. Performing audits\n- Working with auditors vs. Being an auditor\n- Getting certified vs. Providing certification\n- Having external auditors vs. Being an external auditor\n\nThese phrases indicate a company USES audit services (NOT a competitor):\n- \"Works with external auditors\"\n- \"Validated by third-party auditors\"\n- \"Certified by independent auditors\"\n- \"Undergoes regular audits\"\n- \"Partners with compliance auditors\"\n- \"Verified by external assessors\"\n\nThese phrases indicate a company PROVIDES audit services (IS a competitor):\n- \"We perform audits\"\n- \"Our audit services include\"\n- \"We certify other companies\"\n- \"Our auditors assess\"\n- \"We provide compliance verification\"\n\n### HEALTHCARE TECHNOLOGY VENDORS\nDO NOT CLASSIFY AS COMPETITOR WHEN THEY:\n1. List compliance standards they meet\n2. Mention adhering to multiple frameworks\n3. Describe security certifications they've achieved\n4. Market their solutions as compliant\n5. Work with external auditors\n6. Maintain internal compliance programs\n\nCommon statements that do NOT indicate competitive services:\n- \"Our platform is HIPAA, HITRUST, and SOC 2 compliant\"\n- \"We meet NIST 800-53 requirements\"\n- \"Platform certified for multiple compliance frameworks\"\n- \"Solutions built to healthcare compliance standards\"\n- \"Adherence to HITRUST, SOC-2, and HIPAA standards\"\n- \"Validated by external auditors\"\n\n# PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMS - SPECIAL RULES\n\n## AUTOMATIC COMPETITOR CLASSIFICATION\nPublic accounting and professional services firms that list \"Audit\" services are typically competitors, including:\n- Big 4 firms (Deloitte, EY, KPMG, PwC)\n- National accounting firms\n- Regional accounting firms that provide audit services\n- Professional services firms with audit practices\n\n## KEY INDICATORS OF COMPETITION\nWhen a company is a public accounting or professional services firm AND lists any of:\n- \"Audit services\"\n- \"Attestation services\"\n- \"Assurance services\"\n- \"Advisory services\" (in conjunction with audit)\n\nThey should be classified as competitors because these firms typically provide:\n- SOC audits\n- Compliance certifications\n- IT audit services\n- Security attestations\n\n## EXAMPLES\n\n### Example: Large Accounting Firm\n```\nCompany: Major Accounting LLP\nServices: Audit, Tax, Advisory, Consulting\n\nis_partner: FALSE\nis_competitor: TRUE\ncompetitor_reasoning: As a public accounting firm providing audit services, they compete with I.S. Partners in providing SOC audits and compliance certifications.\n```\n\n### Example: Regional Accounting Firm\n```\nCompany: Regional Accounting Group\nServices: Tax, Business Advisory, Wealth Management\n(Note: No audit services listed)\n\nis_partner: FALSE\nis_competitor: FALSE\npartner_reasoning: While an accounting firm, they do not provide audit services and therefore do not compete with I.S.

Their status as manufacturers in regulated industries does NOT make them competitors.\n\n### BEING COMPLIANT VS. PROVIDING COMPLIANCE SERVICES\nA company stating they are compliant with standards is COMPLETELY DIFFERENT from providing compliance services.\n\nDO NOT CONFUSE:\n- Having certifications vs. Providing certifications\n- Being compliant vs. Making others compliant\n- Meeting standards vs. Auditing standards\n- Supporting compliance vs. Auditing compliance\n- Implementing compliant solutions vs. Certifying compliance\n- Manufacturing compliant products vs. Providing compliance audits\n\n### COMPLIANCE KEYWORDS ANALYSIS\n\nTHESE WORDS/PHRASES ALONE DO NOT INDICATE A COMPETITOR:\n- \"Compliant with...\"\n- \"Certified by...\"\n- \"Meets requirements of...\"\n- \"Built to standards of...\"\n- \"Adheres to...\"\n- \"In compliance with...\"\n- \"Achieved certification in...\"\n- \"Compliance support\"\n- \"Compliance implementation\"\n- \"Compliance preparation\"\n- \"Helps achieve compliance\"\n- \"FDA-compliant products\"\n- \"Regulated medical devices\"\n- \"HIPAA-compliant solutions\"\n- \"Internal audit team\"\n- \"Compliance department\"\n- \"Risk management\"\n- \"Regulatory reporting\"\n- \"Sanctions screening\"\n- \"KYC/AML processes\"\n- \"Due diligence\"\n- \"Vendor assessment\"\n- \"Regulatory compliance\"\n- \"Banking compliance\"\n\nTHESE WORDS/PHRASES INDICATE A COMPETITOR:\n- \"We certify...\"\n- \"We audit...\"\n- \"We assess compliance...\"\n- \"Provide certification services...\"\n- \"Compliance auditing...\"\n- \"We validate compliance...\"\n- \"Attestation services...\"\n- \"We verify compliance...\"\n- \"Compliance verification services\"\n- \"We perform compliance audits\"\n- \"Certification authority\"\n- \"Authorized compliance assessor\"\n\n## CLASSIFICATION RULES\n\n### IMMEDIATE DISQUALIFIERS\n- Any organization with .edu or .gov domain → DO NOT CLASSIFY\n- Any organization providing IT compliance audits or certifications → COMPETITOR\n- Organizations with no meaningful connection to IT, security, or compliance → NOT PARTNER\n- Manufacturing companies without audit services → NOT COMPETITOR\n- Financial institutions with only internal compliance → NOT COMPETITOR\n\n### COMPETITOR IDENTIFICATION\nA company is ONLY a competitor if they EXPLICITLY list services that:\n- Provide compliance audit/certification services to other companies\n- Market themselves as compliance auditors\n- Offer formal IT compliance assessments to external clients\n\nMust see these services clearly listed - no assumptions or hypotheticals.\n\n### PARTNER IDENTIFICATION\nA company must meet at least ONE of these criteria to be classified as a PARTNER:\n\n1. Direct Service Complementarity:\n   - Provides compliance readiness or preparation services\n   - Offers cybersecurity implementation or consulting\n   - Provides GRC software platforms\n   - Delivers IT security services or solutions\n   - Implements industry-specific compliant solutions\n\n2. Strong Industry Alignment:\n   - Focus on IT security or risk management\n   - Specializes in regulatory technology\n   - Provides managed security services\n   - Offers data protection solutions\n   - Delivers regulated industry solutions\n\n3. Clear Value Chain Connection:\n   - Services naturally lead to compliance needs\n   - Works with clients likely to need compliance audits\n   - Provides solutions that require compliance validation\n   - Offers complementary risk management services\n\nNOT sufficient for partnership alone:\n- Simply being in the technology sector\n- Having achieved compliance certifications\n- Occasional overlap in client base\n- Basic IT services without security focus\n- Hardware manufacturing, even for regulated industries\n- Being subject to compliance requirements\n- Having internal compliance programs\n- Performing internal audits\n\n## EXAMPLE ANALYSES\n\n### Example 1: Healthcare Technology Provider\n```\nServices Listed:\n- Real-Time Care Intelligence\n- Care coordination\n- Risk reduction\n- Prescription monitoring\n- Behavioral Health\n- Crisis Management\n\nis_partner: TRUE\nis_competitor: FALSE\npartner_reasoning: Provides healthcare technology solutions that require compliance validation.

The goal of this task is to write a two sentence bridge that connects the existing opening line of the email to a specific compliance problem and the pain that problem causes the business.  The two  sentences will be short and direct, with a clear cause and effect between them.\n\n# Writing Guidelines\n\n## Core Style Elements\n* Write at a 4th grade reading level\n* Use natural, conversational language\n* Keep sentences short and direct\n* Use casual abbreviations (b/c, w/, +)\n* Be confident and precise\n* OK to use exclamation points and occasional caps for emphasis\n\n## Language Do's and Don'ts\n\n### DO:\n* Use specific industry terms\n* If the specific frameworks that have are mentioned in the opening line, don't mention them all by name again.  For example, if the opening line says \"I noticed [[company name]] already has SOC 1, SOC 2, PCI DSS...\" then your bridge will refer to these frameworks as \"these frameworks\". \n* Mention team size when relevant\n* Use confident language when speaking about facts (\"means\", \"requires\", \"brings\")\n* Use less confident language when you are unsure (\"could\", \"may\", \"possibly\")\n* Use neutral terms (\"spent on\", \"dedicated to\", \"needed for\")\n* Be specific (\"security requirements\", \"data protection controls\", \"SOC 2 controls\", etc)\n* Prioritize aligning the problem in sentence 1 with the pain it causes in sentence 2.  There must be a direct connection.  This is critical.\n* If the opening line states that  {{ $json.company_info.name }} has ISO 27001 and SOC 2 frameworks, you will speak to the benefits of mapping ISO 27001 and SOC 2 controls:  Identify overlapping controls, removing redundant work and cutting down the time required from your team.   \n\n### DON'T:\n* Use corporate jargon or buzzwords\n* Show uncertainty (\"might\", \"could\", \"maybe\") UNLESS the fact you are stating is subjective, unknown or depends on other factors or variables that are not known.\n* Use negative language (\"lost to\", \"waste\", \"burden\")\n* Be vague (\"compliance rules\", \"extra requirements\")\n* Use emojis\n* Be overly enthusiastic\n* Use unnecessary adjectives\n* Use \"I think...\" statements\n* Make up information\n\n## Examples\n\nWRONG:\n```\n\"I'm reaching out b/c the new partnership might bring extra compliance rules your small team has to follow.\"\n- Uses uncertainty (\"might\")\n- Vague (\"extra compliance rules\")\n- Generic language\n```\n\nRIGHT:\n```\n\"I'm reaching out b/c partnering with institutional data providers means new security requirements to manage.\"\n- Confident (\"means\")\n- Specific (\"security requirements\")\n- Industry-relevant (\"institutional data\")\n```\n\n\n# Format\nTwo sentence bridge that follows this opening line in the email: {{ $json.personalization.sentence_opening }}\n# Required Input\n* First sentence (Personalized Opener): {{ $json.personalization.sentence_opening }}\n* Company name: {{ $json.company_info.name }}\n* Industry: {{ $json.company_info.industry }}\n* Company description/what they do: {{ $json.company_info.report }}\n* Frameworks they have (if known): {{ $json.company_info.framework_review.confirmed_frameworks }}\n* News article summary (if exists): {{ $json.company_info.positive_article.summary }}\n* Type of news: {{ $json.company_info.positive_article.category }}\n* Impact on employees: {{ $json.company_info.positive_article.employee_reaction }}\n* Impact on community: {{ $json.company_info.positive_article.local_impact }}\n* Size of company: {{ $json.company_info.size }}\n* Latest round of funding: {{ $json.company_info.funding.latest_round_year }}\n* Amount of latest round of funding: {{ $json.company_info.funding.latest_round_amount }}\n\n# Pain Points to Include (Use One)\n* Time costs (specific hours per week/month/quarter)\n* Resource requirements (specific team members needed)\n* Revenue impact (delays in deals/partnerships)\n* Team burden (specific tasks/documentation requirements)\n* Compliance costs (audit preparation, certification costs)\n\n# Example Outputs By Scenario\n\n## Has News + No Framework:\n```\nFirst Line: \"I did some research on [[company name]] and saw an article about your acceptance of Medicaid - love seeing how you're making therapy more accessible.\"\n\nBridge Output:\nSentence one: \"I'm reaching out b/c accepting Medicaid means new rules to protect patient info.\"\nSentence two: \"This means your team could spend a ton of time each month just documenting HIPAA procedures and prepping for audits.\"\n```\n\n## Has News + Has Framework:\n```\nFirst Line: \"I saw [[company name]] acquired StarCite - great move!\"\n\nBridge Output:\nSentence one: \"I'm reaching out b/c mergers mean bringing different compliance programs together. \nSentence two: \"Most companies spend 3-4 months aligning their SOC 2 controls after an acquisition.\"\n```\n\n## No News + Has Framework:\n```\nFirst Line: \"I noticed you already have SOC 2 in place - smart move!\"\n\nBridge Output:\nSentence one: \"I'm reaching out b/c maintaining SOC 2 takes up a ton of dev time.\"\nSentence two: \"Most teams spend 40+ hours each quarter just gathering evidence and preparing for audits.\"\n```\n\n## No News + No Framework:\n```\nFirst Line: \"I noticed [[company name]] helps investment managers make better decisions - that's important work!\"\n\nBridge Output:\nSentence one: \"I'm reaching out b/c fintech companies need strong security to win those big enterprise clients.

Why?\n\n1️⃣ Vector is more than \"a company that needs to DO marketing\". We ARE marketing. Marketers love and trust our brand. We represent innovation and life in the boring, aging space of ABM that has left marketers behind.\n\n2️⃣ Our customers & audience need someone they can trust. This role needed to be filled by someone who can captivate and truly educate marketers on the category we're building (Contact-based experience, CBX). A practitioner. The face of a movement.\n\nI turned to a close friend & advisor Daniel J. Murphy (who I'd learned so much from in the early days of Drift and now Exit Five). We debated the typical archetypes of Product Marketing vs. industry practitioner. But when we landed on what a content-veteran background could bring, my heart flipped. I truly believe that at Vector, we market to marketers and that means we have to approach things in creative ways. Building a category, a community.\n\nWhen he pointed me in the direction of Jess Cook... game over. I knew my search was over in the first 5 minutes of chatting with her. 😍\n\nI'm so excited to announce: Jess has joined Vector as our fearless Marketing leader.\n\nFor our customers: Jess is going to drive us to understand you even better. She will deeply impact our product positioning & roadmap direction to continue driving you even more value and innovation in CBX.\n\nFor our community: Jess will empower you to learn, be certified, and drive change with CBX in your organization. There's a mess of noise in the space about ABM, unbundled ABM, signals, intent, and a million other things. Vector will serve as a community of resource (instead of trying to interject software AS the solution).\n\nWelcome, Jess!

here!","totalReactionCount":109,"likeCount":49,"appreciationCount":1,"empathyCount":29,"praiseCount":29,"funnyCount":1,"commentsCount":28,"postUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7298341212300726273/","shareUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/joshuaperk_im-starting-to-run-out-of-space-on-my-laptop-activity-7298341212300726273-JP-i?utm_source=social_share_send&utm_medium=member_desktop_web&rcm=ACoAAFdiL0kBDcdr5IBa3p890zGnRXXmVovJsDE","postedAt":"6d","postedDate":"2025-02-20

And what can you do if you know someone from Meta in NY is looking at your website, but you don't know *who* within the organization it was? \n\nNot actionable, unless you want to spend hours asking around... 🤣 \n\nI'm fascinated by what Vector 👻 is building and have been testing it on my newsletter site...even if people don't subscribe, I can see that they are checking out the newsletter site. I can see which articles they are interested in. I'm finding that people I'm not connected to nor are following me are clicking through to check out the newsletter, which I knew was happening -- but had no idea who it was!\n\nFor a different use case, if I see a specific person from a specific company looking at a product page, I might then want to add them to a Clay table to enrich/action or show them an ad across Meta, X, etc. This means I can be more targeted with my ad and also spend less money targeting...everyone who works at Meta in NY. 😅\n\nLike all data, it isn't perfect -- you can see that some people are still anonymous because they are using adblockers, etc -- but this could be really useful for ABM, with high target/high value accounts. 👀 \n\nAnyways, back to experimentation....would love to hear if anyone is tinkering with Vector 👻 or RB2B or another vendor and to hear about your experience so far!

I get it (and do it too).\n\nThese sorts of statements are designed to let others (LinkedIn followers, potential employers) know you've seen some stuff: built from the ground up.\n\nBut depending on your function, they could actually send a bad sign (especially if your goal is to convince a founder / land at your next early stage 🦄)\n\nHere's why:\n\nThere are only THREE Vector 👻 employees that will ever be able to claim $0 - $xxM\n\nThey're all engineers.\n\n$0 to $x is impressive in product/engineer because it means you saw a company go from idea, zero lines of code to something people wanted. And if you went from $0 to > $2M, you PROBABLY helped get a company to PMF.\n\nBut if you're not an engineer... it could send the wrong message.\n\nBecause companies that hired sales, marketing or success BEFORE $1 of revenue came in are a rare breed. They either:\n👍🏼 Had a great strategy of getting early, free customers with a path to convert to revenue\n👍🏼 Raised a lot of money and were taking big bets\n\nNeither of these are bad (I'm SO sick of the VC vs. bootstrapped debate — just build the company you feel inclined to build).\n\nBut if you raised a lot of money and could take the big bet on sales from $0, we're talking very different worlds in regards to resources and strategy\n\nIt makes me have to ask questions like:\n⁉️ How many sellers were hired out the gate?\n⁉️ Did you also have a ton of other resources (like lots of marketing, SDRs, solutions engineers, enablement?)\n⁉️ Did you feel the pressure of the company failing if you didn't contribute revenue almost immediately?\n\nAgain, if you truly went $0 to $xM that's AWESOME and you have a story to tell.

received 2 of the most humbling compliments this week and if you ever plan to be a founder, there's a great lesson in them.\n\n1️⃣ \"Vector 👻 was a huge topic at our CMO roundtable. You seemingly came out of no where and now you're on everyone's mind.\"\n2️⃣ \"How is your engineering team moving so fast? You're innovating past decade-old companies with major product launches every week.\"\n\nDespite coding for the last 15 years, I was a fish out of water in my much more technical Y Combinator batch ... and boy ... did 99% of VCs make sure to tell me that they could give a damn about what they deemed \"my useless, non-Ivy league engineering background\".\n\nThis bothered me.\n\nWhy did VCs care more about pattern matching 22 year-old Stanford grads over 2 Air Force veterans (pilot & intel analyst) with a combined 35 years of experience coding, leading teams, in the industry we were building in?\n\nAnd more confusingly, how did a bunch of \"non-technical\" founder build one of the fastest-paced product orgs?\n\nWell (let's get this straightened out right away): in the words of my dude, Post Malone, \"I had some help\". We assembled a team that filled all our weaknesses:\n\n- Andrew McGlathery went from $0 - $100M and knew how to lead a team through PMF\n- Samuel Liu had been a YC founder and knew how to build fast because every second mattered\n- Zaina Qasim brought the \"something to prove\" energy that we all marched along to\n\nBut dare I say, just as important:\n- We knew a LOT about what our customers wanted\n- And we knew ENOUGH about how to build it\n\nLet me explain.\n\nI know marketers. I know sellers. These are my people. (Holler... you know who you are 🫶🏼)\n\nI know every. single. pain they experience with their ABM tools, their pipeline. As a VP of Solutions Engineering, I reported to CROs like Josh Allen, Todd Barnett, Andrew Arocha, and Armen M. Zildjian. Knowing what kept them up at night is what kept me employed.\n\nAll of this means, I know what features we're adding every single week for the next 3 years. This gives me a leg up on our competitors who struggle with churn and copy features we've had for a LONG time. They'll NEVER catch us.\n\nAnd my \"unimpressive technical skills\"?\n\nThose are the skills that allow me to know JUST enough about how to scope things, see around corners, and build our roadmap (with Andrew, ofc) in such a way that we ship something new every. single. week.\n\nAll that said, don't get discouraged if you don't fit the VC patterns. After all, investing is all about finding the unicorn that breaks the pattern

Until today.\n\nOut of all the things I learned from David Cancel, Elias Torres and the incredible folks who built Drift like Dave Gerhardt ... one thing stuck with me: swing big, build a category.\n\nToday (with the launch of our new site), I'm thrilled to announce Vector is forging the path for Contact-Based Marketing.\n\nAccount-Based Marketing is broken AF.\n\n- Marketers spend $100k+ on their ABM/ABX platforms\n- The have to believe in blackbox intent algorithms\n- Then their sales team (rightfully) doesn't adopt them ... because \"Someone at your target account\" doesn't mean anything\n\nContact-Based Marketing is where modern marketers are going.\n- Much more affordable\n- Surface the ACTUAL contacts that are in-market (no more hiding behind fluff)\n- Create 1:1 CBM plans for the buyers you truly care about (like enrolling them in ad campaigns only THEY will see)\n\nThank you to all our incredible customers and team members that made this happen 🙏🏼\n\nIf you're tired of getting ghosted by your expensive, legacy ABM provider, 📞 me.","totalReactionCount":82,"likeCount":54,"appreciationCount":1,"empathyCount":13,"praiseCount":14,"commentsCount":26,"postUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7262795486904954881/","shareUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/joshuaperk_last-week-the-cmo-of-usergems-told-me-she-activity-7262795486904954881-8jOt?utm_source=social_share_send&utm_medium=member_desktop_web&rcm=ACoAAFdiL0kBDcdr5IBa3p890zGnRXXmVovJsDE","postedAt":"3mo","postedDate":"2024-11-14 11:56:20.293 +0000 UTC","postedDateTimestamp":1731585380293,"urn":"7262795486904954881","author":{"id":325126413,"firstName":"Joshua","lastName":"Perk 👻","headline":"Founder @ Vector (YC W23)","username":"joshuaperk","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshuaperk","profilePictures":[{"width":100,"height":100,"url":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E03AQEoMyEWRj10Rg/profile-displayphoto-shrink_100_100/profile-displayphoto-shrink_100_100/0/1729390559104?e=1746057600&v=beta&t=duw8sJgDO4wslwdWeg5wGD3PzMTTqctc1g9LrUwJoiY"},{"width":200,"height":200,"url":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E03AQEoMyEWRj10Rg/profile-displayphoto-shrink_200_200/profile-displayphoto-shrink_200_200/0/1729390559104?e=1746057600&v=beta&t=bpG7SaA5l87bxCXLj1luuiM44V1ZsUFE5K8sHq7gvb0"},{"width":400,"height":400,"url":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E03AQEoMyEWRj10Rg/profile-displayphoto-shrink_400_400/profile-displayphoto-shrink_400_400/0/1729390559104?e=1746057600&v=beta&t=E1a1qksq1dl0DBUYmW4uT-FDgJl9t-BcxhKlCwF5t1c"},{"width":500,"height":500,"url":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E03AQEoMyEWRj10Rg/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1729390559112?e=1746057600&v=beta&t=YwNGpMKbcknubCXpD6caO3R26wZ2qHPTQVIajh8H7bo"}],"urn":"urn:li:fsd_profile:ACoAABNhCQ0B-jI3au92KJtQPN0kN_ISl8I3Qak"},"image":[{"url":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E22AQGlNL4yZRo_yw/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/0/1731557073958?e=1743638400&v=beta&t=dBP991Zea6IOG18DnMT69pVkH_S29CLByLl1SB1ktCk","width":2048,"height":1266},{"url":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E22AQGlNL4yZRo_yw/feedshare-shrink_20/feedshare-shrink_20/0/1731557073896?e=1743638400&v=beta&t=iYnAgcIyUAadIpUVInVlp2r0yV7ZX3SKcs7N6pGOLvQ","width":20,"height":12},{"url":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E22AQGlNL4yZRo_yw/feedshare-shrink_1280/feedshare-shrink_1280/0/1731557073896?e=1743638400&v=beta&t=C4Fo811JLCkddxxM7saC4WCIvWtU5kfyUj_NlI71a5s","width":1280,"height":791},{"url":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E22AQGlNL4yZRo_yw/feedshare-shrink_480/feedshare-shrink_480/0/1731557073896?e=1743638400&v=beta&t=zpIXAqqGdY86sX2ivlgqdi99C_GBQAoRtufnZIjKcDA","width":480,"height":297},{"url":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E22AQGlNL4yZRo_yw/feedshare-shrink_160/feedshare-shrink_160/0/1731557073350?e=1743638400&v=beta&t=7GjG8Xc4CLxb_xyW3ispfhI1FlbK-U01g_aiai3Ri_g","width":160,"height":99},{"url":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E22AQGlNL4yZRo_yw/feedshare-shrink_800/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1731557073350?e=1743638400&v=beta&t=EQjBKyMIAvNhNRRVcUWegzEl79zqWjCuOhCFA48zOkw","width":800,"height":495}],"company":{},"document":{},"celebration":{},"poll":{},"article":{"newsletter":{}},"entity":{},"mentions":[{"firstName":"Trinity","lastName":"Nguyen💎","urn":"ACoAAAF0wCoBtT9U9j7LCh9MyRqcalNC7Av82ss","publicIdentifier":"trinitynguyen"},{"firstName":"David","lastName":"Cancel","urn":"ACoAAAAAY2QBpXb_fSnNd8uc__6gsd0Em5RZUY4","publicIdentifier":"dcancel"},{"firstName":"Elias","lastName":"Torres","urn":"ACoAAABBD00ByMD4GBxSkgqb4kEh1mYqxN99tzQ","publicIdentifier":"eliast"},{"firstName":"Dave","lastName":"Gerhardt","urn":"ACoAAAMHmy0BsuPDDLlqXC9Yb-wdBIHXsniqM44","publicIdentifier":"davegerhardt"}],"companyMentions":[{"id":91661940,"name":"Vector 👻","publicIdentifier":"getvector","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/getvector/"}]},{"isBrandPartnership":false,"text":"Vanity metrics don't matter.

Yes, but your mileage will vary per your ICP.\n\nWhile Google still has an overwhelming 80%+ marketshare on search volume in the U.S., the conversational form factor has won a place as a \"daily driver\" for many personas. It's not a far cry of the imagination to presume this newfound ability to digest 10+ sources at once won't be the preferred experience for many.\n\nWhat does this mean for marketers? You now have 3 overlords to appease.\n\nWriting good content for humans is hard. Writing for humans AND Google indexing was harder. Hardest? Writing for humans, search engine indexing, and LLMs. Fortunately, Google's algo has strayed away from the black magic days of keyword cramming and favored human-readable content. But LLMs are still wild west. They're easily influenced and I wouldn't be surprised to see particularly savvy growth marketers try to find ways to hack-fluencer their way into ChatGPTs recommendations.\n\nIt also means marketers will see even LESS traffic (despite OpenAI claiming this will promote users visiting the cited sources). This means less 1st party signal. And even less awareness that buyers are in-market.\n\nI spent some time asking how my company Vector stacked up against 6sense.
