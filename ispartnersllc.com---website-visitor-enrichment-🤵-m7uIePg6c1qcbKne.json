PARTNERS\nI.S. Partners provides various IT compliance and audit services, including SOC 1, SOC 2, SOC 3, ISO 27001, PCI DSS, and other related certifications. They offer services such as readiness assessments, gap analysis, implementation support, and formal audits to help organizations achieve and maintain compliance with various security and data protection standards. For example, I.S. Partners will help companies achieve ISO-27001 certification or audit a company to ensure they are SOC 2 compliant. \n# IT AUDIT AND COMPLIANCE SERVICES\nHere are the IT audit and compliance services that I.S. Partners offers: \n**IT audit and compliance services**\n- SOC 1\n- SOC 2\n- SOC 3\n- SOC for Cybersecurity\n- SOC for Supply Chain\n- HIPAA/HITECH and HITRUST\n- PCI DSS\n- ISO Certifications (ISO 27001, ISO 42001, ISO 50001)\n- CMMC\n- CCPA and GDPR\n- GLBA\n- FISMA\n- MAR/SOX\n- MARS-E\n- NERC\n- NYDFS\n- Risk Assessments\n**Artificial Intelligence audit and compliance services**\n- NIST AI RMF\n- ISO 42001\n- HITRUST AI RMF\n**Cybersecurity audit and compliance services**\n- NIST CSF\n- SP 800-53\n- NIST Cybersecurity for IoT\n- NIST AI Risk Management (NIST AI RMF)\n# TARGET COMPANY \nCompany name: ${$json.company_info.name}\nWebsite: ${$json.company_info.domain}\nCompany LinkedIn:  ${$json.company_info.social_urls.linked_in}\nIndustry: ${industries}\nSpecialities: ${specialities}\n# CLASSIFICATION GUIDE\n## COMPETITORS\nA competitor would be any company that provides IT compliance and audit services, including SOC 1, SOC 2, SOC 3, ISO 27001, PCI DSS, and other related certifications on the list below. They may offer services such as readiness assessments and gap analysis in addition to implementation support, and formal audits to help organizations achieve and maintain compliance with various security and data protection standards.\n### EXAMPLE - EXISTING COMPETITORS\nBelow is a list of companies that are competitors of I.S. Partners.  This is not a complete list - it is just a few of the thousands of potential competitors.  You can use this list to help you classify the target company as a competitor.   \n- Kirkpatrick Price: A cybersecurity and compliance audit firm specializing in SOC 1, SOC 2, PCI DSS, ISO 27001, and other IT compliance audits, offering a user-friendly platform and expert guidance throughout the audit process12.\n- A-lign: A cybersecurity and compliance solutions provider offering various audit and assessment services, including SOC, ISO, PCI, and HITRUST certifications.\n- Deloitte: A multinational professional services network providing audit, consulting, financial advisory, risk advisory, tax, and legal services across various industries.\n- BARR Advisory: A cloud-based security and compliance solutions provider specializing in cybersecurity consulting and compliance audits for various frameworks.\n- Prescient Security: A cybersecurity consulting firm offering security assessments, penetration testing, and compliance services.\n- RSI Security: A managed security services provider offering comprehensive cybersecurity solutions and compliance services for various industries and regulatory frameworks.\n- Schellman: A global independent security and privacy compliance assessor, providing various IT audit and certification services across multiple frameworks and standards.\n- KPMG: A multinational professional services network offering audit, tax, and advisory services, including IT compliance and cybersecurity solutions.\n- Ernst & Young (EY): A global professional services firm providing assurance, consulting, strategy, transactions, and tax services, including compliance and regulatory advisory services.\n- Hancock Askew & Co.: A regional accounting and advisory firm offering various services, including IT assurance and cybersecurity compliance audits.\n## PARTNERS\nCompanies that offer services and solutions like Cyber Insurance, Legal and Regulatory Consulting, Business Continuity Planning, Financial Auditing, Physical Security, Employee Training, Data Backup, Digital Forensics, Incident Response (DFIR), Managed IT Services, or Cloud Hosting and Infrastructure Services are potential partners. \nThese companies may provide services related to IT Compliance, but if IT compliance and audit services  (e.g., SOC 2 compliance, ISO certification, NIST certification, PCI DSS certification, HITRUST certification,etc.) are not their primary offering, they should be considered as potential partners.\nSpecifically:\n- If a company only provides IT compliance and audit readiness or preperation services, and does not provide the actual audit, they are potential partners. \n- If a company primarily sells these non-compliance services but does not specialize in IT Compliance audits or certifications, they could complement our offerings.\n- They could be a good partner for us in delivering comprehensive solutions where IT Compliance intersects with their services.\n - Such companies are probably not a competitor unless they position themselves as a specialist in IT compliance and audit frameworks like SOC 2 or ISO 27001.\n- Education, Government and Federal organizations are NOT to be considered as either competitors or partners.  You can identify Education organizations because their websites have the .edu domain extension.  Government and Federal organizations have websites and domains that end in .gov.  DO NOT CLASSIFY EDUCATION OR GOVERNMENT (LOCAL OR FEDERAL) ORGANIZATIONS AS COMPETITORS OR PARTNERS.\nIdentify companies as potential partners if they do not provide IT and cybersecurity compliance, certification, audits, and assessments as their core service or solution offering.\n### EXAMPLE - EXISTING PARTNERS\nHere are our existing partners.  You can use these companies to help classify partner opportunities: \n- 3factor: Cybersecurity consulting firm offering white glove cybersecurity solutions.\n- Alvarez Technology Group Inc: Provider of IT services and consulting in Salinas.\n- Arrakis Consulting: Full-service cybersecurity company specializing in various cybersecurity solutions.\n- Axiotrop: Offers cybersecurity assessment, remediation, and validation services.\n- Bemo: SaaS provider specializing in Hosted Project Portfolio Management solutions.\n- CTN Solutions: Managed IT service provider offering various IT services.\n- Connectivtech: Fractional CTO organization specializing in IT Procurement and vendor management.\n- Consilium Labs: Specializes in ISO certification services, particularly ISO/IEC 27001.\n- DEKRA: Global expert organization dedicated to safety across various industries.\n- Delaney Computer Services, Inc.: Provides managed IT services, cybersecurity, and IT support.\n- Drata: Advanced security and compliance automation platform.\n- Eden Data: Cybersecurity company providing virtual CISO leadership and professional services.\n- Fieldguide: Enterprise software company offering automation and collaboration software for risk and compliance.\n- GRSee Consulting: Information security firm from Israel with expertise in leading cybersecurity projects.\n- HITRUST Alliance: Focuses on information and privacy security, regulatory compliance, and risk management.\n- Ihloom: Managed cybersecurity company providing critical and comprehensive cybersecurity services.\n- KPInterface: Managed Security Service Provider (MSSP) based in Philadelphia.\n- Lumifi Cyber: Managed Security Service Provider (MDR) based in Scottsdale, AZ.\n- Magna5: Offers managed IT, cybersecurity, data backup & recovery, SD WAN, and cloud solutions.\n- Pondurance: Provides managed detection and response services backed by human intelligence.\n- PreVeil: Offers end-to-end encryption solutions for email, file sharing, and more.\n- Raxis LLC: Top-tier penetration testing services company based in Atlanta.\n- Sniper Watch: Provider of AI-powered cybersecurity solutions.\n- Subrosa Cyber: Cybersecurity company specializing in expert penetration testing services.\n- Twintel: IT company providing comprehensive IT services to Orange County, CA businesses.\n- Valander Group: Veteran-owned consortium of subject matter experts in various fields.\n- nGuard, Inc.: Provides info security solutions with security experts and custom-tailored services.\n# TASK\n1. Determine if the target company is an educational institution or government (local or federal) agency or organization.  If it is, do not progress to step 3.  Terminate the task. Government organizations/agencies can usually be identified by their website or domain, which has the .gov domain extension.  Educational institutions can be determined by their website or domain, which ends in .edu.\n2. Carefully analyze what the target company does - what services, solutions and products they sell or offer and describe it in one or two sentences.  \n3. Carefully compare the services and solutions that I.S. Partners provides to the those of the target company ( ${$json.company_info.name}) and determine if the target company is a competitor.\n4. Carefully compare the services and solutions that I.S. Partners provides to the those of the target company ( ${$json.company_info.name}) and determine if the target company is a potential partner.\n5. Make a clear determination of whether the target company is a competitor or I.S. Partners or a potential partner of I.S. Partners, or neither.  You will classify the target company based on the solutions and services they offer compared to I.S. Partners\n6. Explain your reasoning\n7. If a target company is neither a competitor or partner, do nothing.  \n8. You are judged on accuracy and not how many companies you identify as competitors or partners. \n# CRITICAL RULES\n1. If a company provides or sells an IT audit or compliance service that I.S. Partners offers, it is a competitor.  \n2. Only classify as PARTNER if you can confirm they don't perform competing services\n3. Focus on actual services offered, not just marketing language\n4. Government and federal agencies and organizations with websites that end in .gov are NOT competitors or partners. \n5. Companies that provide GRC software in a SaaS (Software as a Service) model are not typically competitors but partners. These companies provide software that helps organizations and auditors facilitate compliance audits or certifications. They typically do not provide the actual audit itself, so they would be considered partners. These companies include Drata, Vanta, SecureFrame, OneLogic, etc. \n6. A company may have achieved IT compliance or certification, but that does not influence if they are a partner or competitor.  For example, a target company may have achieved SOC 2 Compliance and mentions it on their website, but this has no influence on their standing as a potential partner or competitor.  Do not consider - or look for - if the company has achieved IT compliance or certification.  ONLY IF THEY PROVIDE SOLUTIONS TO OTHER COMPANIES TO HELP THEM ACHIEVE COMPLIANCE.  \n8. Only consider the IT compliance and audit solutions that I.S. Partners offers when considering if a target company is a potential partner or competitor.  Companies that offer compliance audits or certifications outside of what I.S. Partners offers are not in competition with I.S. Partners.\n\n### OUTPUT\n- IS GOVERNMENT/EDUCATION ORGANIZATION?  True/False\n- IS PARTNER?  True/False\n- IS COMPETITOR?  True/False\n- REASONING:[Explain key factors in decision]\n- SERVICES ANALYSIS:[List relevant services identified]\n- CONFIDENCE LEVEL:[High/Medium/Low - explain if more information needed]\n### ACCURACY STATEMENT\nYour classification is critical.  Accuracy is of the utmost importance.  Incorrect classification of a target company can destroy your relationship with us and terminate the agreement.  Your ouput must be as accurate as possible.\n`\n\nreturn {prompt: prompt}"},"type":"n8n-nodes-base.code","typeVersion":2,"position":[11660,1840],"id":"94941092-9a76-4072-b909-115db291becd","name":"Competitor Partner classification - prompt"},{"parameters":{"jsonSchemaExample":"{\n  \"is_government\": \"False\",\n  \"is_partner\": \"True\",\n  \"is_competitor\": \"False\",\n  \"services_offered\": \"Cloud Hosting and Managed IT Services\",\n  \"competitor_partner_reasoning\": \"The target company offers Managed IT Services and Cloud Hosting, which complements the services offered by I.S.

Compliance Frameworks/Certifications: Identify security and compliance frameworks from the specified list (e.g., SOC 1, SOC 2, HIPAA, HITRUST, PCI DSS, ISO 27001, etc.).\n2. Vendors/Certifying Bodies: Look for mentions of vendors, auditing firms, or certifying bodies responsible for issuing the certifications (e.g., \"audited by [Vendor]\" or \"certified by [Auditor]\").\n3. Certification Validity Timeframes: Capture the certification’s start and expiration dates (e.g., \"valid from [date]\" or \"expires on [date]\").\n\nTarget Frameworks/Certifications:\n- SOC 1\n- SOC 2\n- SOC 3\n- ISO 27001\n- HIPAA\n- PCI DSS\n- HITRUST\n- NIST AI RMF\n- HITRUST AI RMF\n- NIST AI Risk Management\n- NIST Cybersecurity for IoT\n- ISO 42001\n- ISO 50001\n- CMMC\n- CCPA\n- GDPR\n- GLBA\n- FISMA\n- MAR/SOX\n- MARS-E\n- NERC\n- NYDFS\n- NIST CSF\n- NIST SP 800-53\n### SEARCH TARGETS\n1.  Trust Center, Security, and Compliance Pages:\n   - Focus on pages or sections that reference \"Trust Center,\" \"Security,\" \"Compliance,\" or \"Certifications.\"\n   - **Keywords:** \"SOC 2,\" \"HIPAA,\" \"ISO 27001,\" \"PCI DSS,\" \"certified by,\" \"audited by,\" \"framework,\" \"vendor,\" \"security page,\" \"compliance certifications.\"\n2. Press Releases and Blog Announcements:\n   - Focus on announcements of new certifications, renewals, or partnerships with auditing firms or vendors.\n   - Keywords: “SOC 2 certified,” “ISO 27001 certification,” “audit completed by [Vendor],” “compliance certification announcement.”\n3. Corporate Reports (Annual, Security, Governance):\n   - Search for security or governance reports that summarize compliance frameworks from the list. Look for references to auditing firms and certification validity periods.\n4. Search Engines\n- Searches:\n- site: ${$json.company_info.domain}  trust center\n- site:  ${$json.company_info.domain}\n\n <framework/certification>\n- intext:\"${$json.company_info.domain} trust center\"\n- intext:\"${$json.company_info.domain} compliance\"\n-  \"${$json.company_info.domain}\"\n\n\n  <framework> certification/compliance \n- Keywords: “Annual Security Report,” “Governance Report,” “SOC 2 certification,” “compliance summary,” “audited by [Vendor],” “valid from [date].”\n5. Frameworks/Certifications: SOC 1, SOC 2, SOC 3, HIPAA, HITRUST, ISO 27001, PCI DSS, CMMC, GDPR, NIST AI RMF, cybersecurity frameworks.\n6. Vendors/Certifying Bodies: Audited by, certified by, issued by, audit firm, vendor, certifying authority, security partner.\n\n### Fields Explained:\n1. **company_name:** The name of the company from which the data is scraped.\n   \n2. **compliance_frameworks:** An array that lists each compliance framework or certification the company has implemented. Each entry contains:\n    - **framework_name:** The name of the compliance framework or certification (e.g., SOC 2, ISO 27001).\n    - **vendor:** The auditing firm, vendor, or certifying body responsible for issuing or verifying the certification (e.g., \"Audited by [Vendor]\").\n    - **validity_period:** An object that includes:\n        - **valid_from:** The start date of the certification or audit validity.\n        - **expires_on:** The expiration or renewal date for the certification.\n  \n3. **source:** The URL of the page from which the data was extracted, for tracking and verification purposes.\n\n### Example JSON Response:\n\n- **Timeframes:** Valid from, valid until, expires on, certification period, issued on, expiry date, validity, renewal date.\n### IMPORTANT\n- You must ensure that you are researching the correct company.  Many companies have similar names and domains.  The company you are researching is called ${$json.company_info.name}, has \n${$json.company_info.domain} as their domain and can be found at this linkedin page: ${$json.company_info.social_urls.linked_in}\n\n\n\n  \n- Be aware that GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA and other privacy certifications and frameworks are often mentioned on websites because the company complies with them.  This may not mean they are actually certified to be compliant.  For example, many websites have a cookie acknowledgement that visitors have to acknowledge.  These cookie policies often mention GDPR and CCPA.  Do not confuse this with the actual certification.  \n- If you are taking information from an online source, such as a Press Release, the information in the \"About\" section (or other section that contains the company's contact information) you must verify that the company mentioned is the same EXACT company as our prospect. \n- Many websites impersonate ${$json.company_info.name} - you will ensure that if you visit ${$json.company_info.name}'s website, that you are visiting the domain ${$json.company_info.domain}\n.  \n\n### FICTIONAL EXAMPLES\n- Our target company is called Vector and you were told their website/domain is vector.co.  During a Google Search you find a company called Vector Solutions and you visit their website at vectorsolutions.com.  You should not be on vectorsolutions.com because it is the domain of the wrong company.   You risk providing the world with fake, harmful information. \n- Our target company is Acme with a website/domain at acme.net.  You search Google and find a press release that mentions Acme has achieved HITRUST Certification.  At the bottom of the press release, there is an about section.  In the about section, the company Acme is mentioned, along with the website acme.net.  This is a reliable press release because the website/domain matches the target company. \n# Example 3\nOur target company is called Giant Inc and have the website/domain smallthings.com.  You search Google and find a result that says \"Giant achieves ISO 27001 Certification\".  You click to the website, which is at smallthings.com.jp and owned by a company called \"Giant Small Things\".  Since the domains do not match and the company names do not match exactly, you will not consider this website.  You are putting the world at risk of contaminating it with fake information because you are not on the correct companys website. \n\n### YOUR RESPONSE  / EXAMPLES\n- Your response should be structured following this object:\n{\n\"SOC_1\": \"false\",\n\"SOC_2\": \"true\",\n\"HIPAA_HITECH\": \"true\",\n\"PCI_DSS\": \"false\",\n\"ISO_27001\": \"false\",\n\"ISO_42001\": \"false\",\n\"ISO_50001\": \"false\",\n\"CMMC\": \"false\",\n\"CCPA\": \"true\",\n\"GDPR\": \"true\",\n\"GLBA\": \"false\",\n\"FISMA\": \"false\",\n\"MAR_SOX\": \"false\",\n\"MARS_E\": \"false\",\n\"NERC\": \"false\",\n\"NYDFS\": \"false\",\n\"NIST_AI_RMF\": \"false\",\n\"HITRUST_AI_RMF\": \"false\",\n\"NIST_CSF\": \"false\",\n\"NIST_SP_800_53\": \"false\",\n\"NIST_Cybersecurity_for_IOT\": \"false\",\n\"website_found_on\": \"Example1.com\",\n\"steps_taken\" : [\"Performed a Google Search on the company\", \"Checked the company’s website for trust center or security pages\", \"Verified the information on LinkedIn\", \"Scrutinized their blog posts\", \"Cross-referenced with reliable third-party platforms\"],\n\"reasoning\":\"The company's trust center on their website made it clear that they are SOC 2, HIPAA and CCPA compliant, and adhere to GDPR regulations.

Vendors/Auditors/Certifying Bodies:  The companies that helped them achieve compliance or certification may mention it on their websites or in press releases.  They may mentioned things like Audited by, certified by, issued by, audit firm, vendor, certifying authority, security partner.\n6. GRC Software Vendors: Companies such as Drata, Vanta, Secureframe, OneLogic and others often have case studies or testimonials from companies who have used them to help facilitate the audit or certification.\n### EVALUATION GUIDELINES\nWhen assessing compliance claims, verify:\n## Credibility\n- Is it from an official source (company domain, verified auditor, or industry database)?\n- Are specific auditors, dates, and certification details provided?\n- Do multiple sources confirm the same information?\n## Currency\n- Is the certification active and maintained?\n- Are there recent updates or ongoing activities?\n- Watch for outdated claims or expired certifications\n## Red Flags\n- Generic compliance statements without specifics\n- Claims mismatched with industry/business type\n- Information only in privacy policies/terms\n- Missing key details (dates, auditors, scope)\n### OUTPUT EXAMPLES\nThese output examples are completely fake examples and are not to be used in your research.

Here are the specific frameworks being evaluated: \n\nIT Compliance and Certification:\n- SOC 1\n- SOC 2\n- HIPAA/HITECH\n- HITRUST\n- PCI DSS\n- ISO 27001\n- ISO 42001\n- ISO 50001\n- CMMC\n- CCPA and GDPR\n- GLBA\n- FISMA\n- MAR/SOX\n- MARS-E\n- NERC\n- NYDFS\nArtificial Intelligence Compliance:\n- NIST AI RMF\n- ISO 42001\n- HITRUST AI RMF\nCybersecurity and Risk Management:\n- NIST CSF\n- NIST SP 800-53\n- NIST Cybersecurity for IoT\n- NIST AI Risk Management\nNote: These are the only frameworks and certifications you will evaluate.\n\n### Output\n- Analysis:  Provide your analysis of the research.  \n- Revisions: If the research has innacuracies, provide corrections so we can update our reseach with more accurate information.\n- Confirmed Company:  You will confirm that the company our team has found compliance certifications and frameworks for is, in fact, the target company ${$json.company_info.name} with the domain ${$json.company_info.domain}.\n- Confirmed Frameworks:  You will ONLY list the frameworks that you are 100% confident our target \n${$json.company_info.name} has achieved for THEMSELVES and can confirm.  Do not provide an explanation or reasoning here.  Just an array.   If there are no certifications or frameworks that ${$json.company_info.name} has achieved for themselves that you can confirm, respond with empty array. If ${$json.company_info.name} provides the compliance certification or framework to other companies, and have not achieved the certification or framework for themselves, then DO NOT LIST that framework or certification as \"Confirmed\".   CONFIRMED FRAMEWORKS AND CERTIFCATIONS ARE ONLY FRAMEWORKS AND CERTIFCATIONS THE TARGET COMPANY HAS ACHIEVED FOR THEMSELVES.\n- Unconfirmed Frameworks:  List the frameworks that were wronly attributed to the target company or frameworks that you are not confident they have and/or cannot confirm. Do not provide an explanation or reasoning here.  Just list the frameworks in an array\n- Confirmed GRC Platforms/Software:   List the GRC Tools that you are confident they use and can confirm. If there are no confirmed GRC platforms, then respond with \"Not Found\"\n- Confirmed auditors:  List the auditors that you are confident they use and can confirm.  If there are no confirmed auditors, then respond with \"Not Found\"\n- Steps taken:Steps taken refers to the process or actions you performed in order to verify the information provided by researchers. This should include, but not be limited to, looking up the company on their own website, on social media (particularly LinkedIn), seeking references to the company in relation to compliance on third party websites or authoritative sources, and cross-referencing all findings to confirm they apply to the correct company—not one simply with a similar name.\n- Reasoning:Steps taken refers to the process or actions you performed in order to verify the information provided by researchers. This should include, but not be limited to, looking up the company on their own website, on social media (particularly LinkedIn), seeking references to the company in relation to compliance on third party websites or authoritative sources, and cross-referencing all findings to confirm they apply to the correct company—not one simply with a similar name.\n- Confidence Level: \nConfidence Level is your final, overall judgment on the validity or veracity of the entire set of information presented by your research and verification process. This would generally encapsulate how sure you are that the details—if published—would hold up as factual, accurate and true. High confidence would denote you have no, or very minor, reservations about the truth of the findings. Medium confidence would indicate there are some uncertainties in the obtained information. Low confidence would be reserved for instances where considerable doubts exist about many or key aspects of the findings.\n\n\n### IMPORTANT\n- THIS IS CRITICAL - WE WILL DESTORY OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE CUSTOMER IF THIS IS NOT ACCURATE: You must ensure that you are researching the company named ${$json.company_info.name} that matches the company found at ${$json.company_info.social_urls.linked_in}.   Many companies have similar names and domains.  The company you are researching is called ${$json.company_info.name}, has ${$json.company_info.domain} as their domain and can be found at this linkedin page: ${$json.company_info.social_urls.linked_in}.\n- Be aware that GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA and other privacy certifications and frameworks are often mentioned on websites because the company complies with them.  This may not mean they are actually certified to be compliant.  For example, many websites have a cookie acknowledgement that visitors have to acknowledge.  These cookie policies often mention GDPR and CCPA.  Do not confuse this with the actual certification.  \n### ACCURACY STATEMENT\n- You will verify that your ouput is for ${$json.company_info.name}, who is the same company at this LinkedIn URL: ${$json.company_info.social_urls.linked_in}. If you do not have high confience that the certifications and frameworks that you found in your research (on search engines and other sources) are for this exact company, respond with \"Low Confidence\" \n- If the website does not have a \"Trust Center\" or other sections prooving thier commitment to data security and compliance, then search Google\n-  You MUST document the steps you have taken, specifically any google searches you made\n- If you are taking information from an online source, such as a Press Release, the information in the \"About\" section (or other section that contains the company's contact information) you must verify that the company mentioned is the same EXACT company as our prospect.  \n- ALWAYS CLEAR YOUR CACHE BEFORE SEARCHING.  YOUR JOB DEPENDS ON FRESH INFORMATION\n`\n\nreturn {prompt:prompt}"},"type":"n8n-nodes-base.code","typeVersion":2,"position":[16520,2600],"id":"eb448a16-6a74-45e0-af06-5a773a2dbc17","name":"Frameworks Review - Prompt"},{"parameters":{"options":{}},"type":"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmChatOpenAi","typeVersion":1,"position":[8920,2820],"id":"12b86683-05e5-4332-b4ea-03b25e19acc6","name":"OpenAI Chat Model - Page Info","credentials":{"openAiApi":{"id":"mzHalaHzUD5jrTet","name":"searchactions.com: ispartnersllc.com - Website Visitor Enrichmen"}}},{"parameters":{"options":{}},"type":"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmChatOpenAi","typeVersion":1,"position":[9940,2800],"id":"5a6f090e-6f1e-46dc-9154-b51c681b89bd","name":"OpenAI Chat Model - Company Info","credentials":{"openAiApi":{"id":"mzHalaHzUD5jrTet","name":"searchactions.com: ispartnersllc.com - Website Visitor Enrichmen"}}},{"parameters":{"options":{"maxRetries":10}},"type":"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmChatOpenAi","typeVersion":1,"position":[10840,2800],"id":"c719caa7-4c79-4a80-92ea-f2973eef905b","name":"OpenAI Chat Model - Contact info.","credentials":{"openAiApi":{"id":"mzHalaHzUD5jrTet","name":"searchactions.com: ispartnersllc.com - Website Visitor Enrichmen"}}},{"parameters":{"options":{}},"type":"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmChatOpenAi","typeVersion":1,"position":[11840,2040],"id":"d64e2bb0-892b-4fbc-b1a5-23119afd79d0","name":"OpenAI Chat Model - Competitor / Partner  Classification","credentials":{"openAiApi":{"id":"mzHalaHzUD5jrTet","name":"searchactions.com: ispartnersllc.com - Website Visitor Enrichmen"}}},{"parameters":{"options":{}},"type":"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmChatOpenAi","typeVersion":1,"position":[13880,2800],"id":"2d4e011b-b779-4407-91f9-34490529596f","name":"OpenAI Chat Model - Auditor & GRC Tool","credentials":{"openAiApi":{"id":"mzHalaHzUD5jrTet","name":"searchactions.com: ispartnersllc.com - Website Visitor Enrichmen"}}},{"parameters":{"options":{}},"type":"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmChatOpenAi","typeVersion":1,"position":[14860,2800],"id":"f911509d-6f82-480f-9623-504608391de4","name":"OpenAI Chat Model - Framework First","credentials":{"openAiApi":{"id":"mzHalaHzUD5jrTet","name":"searchactions.com: ispartnersllc.com - Website Visitor Enrichmen"}}},{"parameters":{"options":{}},"type":"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmChatOpenAi","typeVersion":1,"position":[15720,2820],"id":"f1267d0d-c15e-4ab9-bbd9-1ae166597a8b","name":"OpenAI Chat Model - Framework Second","credentials":{"openAiApi":{"id":"mzHalaHzUD5jrTet","name":"searchactions.com: ispartnersllc.com - Website Visitor Enrichmen"}}},{"parameters":{"options":{}},"type":"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmChatOpenAi","typeVersion":1,"position":[16680,2800],"id":"563cf684-86d1-478b-b392-0df5dd454609","name":"OpenAI Chat Model - Framework Review","credentials":{"openAiApi":{"id":"mzHalaHzUD5jrTet","name":"searchactions.com: ispartnersllc.com - Website Visitor Enrichmen"}}},{"parameters":{"jsonSchemaExample":"{\n\"analysis\":\"The information provided by both researchers is detailed.

Tier 3  (26/62 Points)\nSummary:\nNationwide is a large insurance and financial services provider with over 10,000 employees. Currently, there are no confirmed compliance frameworks, which can present challenges in navigating compliance requirements. The interest is shown through the visit to a blog about SOC 2, suggesting a potential need for compliance solutions. While the contact's role as a Paralegal may limit influence, engaging those higher in the organizational hierarchy could be beneficial for compliance-related solutions.\n\n### Job Title Score\nTotal Score:  3/12 Points\nJob Title:  Limited Influence - Paralegal\nReasoning:  The prospect's title is 'Paralegal,' which falls under 'Other Roles' category as it does not have a direct influence on security or compliance decisions.\n\n### Industry Title Score\nTotal Score: 8/8 Points\nIndustry:  Target Industry - Insurance\nReasoning:  The industry is 'Insurance,' which is a target industry for compliance-focused solutions, particularly relevant for organizations like financial services.\n\n### Location Score\nTotal Score: 2/8 Points\nLocal: ,   (Not Local)\nReasoning:  There is no location information provided. Thus, we cannot confirm whether the location is within 60 miles of Philadelphia, which leads to the default score of 1.\n\n### Company Size Score\nTotal Score: 4/4 Points\nEmployee Count: 500+ Employees\nReasoning:  The employee count for Nationwide is stated as '10001+,' which qualifies for the '500+ employees' category.\n\n### Frameworks\nTotal Score: 3/12 Points\nFrameworks:  No Frameworks Found\nReasoning:  It's mentioned that 'None Confirmed' for frameworks. As there are no frameworks listed, it defaults to score 1. Trust Services Criteria is mentioned in the page visited but is not confirmed as implemented.\nResearch:  /aThe findings indicate a significant gap in available public documentation regarding specific compliance certifications for Nationwide. No definitive confirmation of certifications such as SOC 2, HIPAA, or others listed was discovered through various means. The emphasis on general compliance measures rather than concrete certifications could suggest a focus on operational compliance rather than formalized audits or assessments. Additionally, the lack of reference to specific auditors or GRC tools used by Nationwide indicates a potential absence of rigor in third-party compliance verification for the information available.\n\n### Intent\nTotal Score: 6/18 Points\nIntent:  General Research\nPage Visited:  https://www.ispartnersllc.com/blog/understanding-trust-service-principles\nTopic of Page:  Compliance and Information Security\nReasoning:  The page visited is a blog article, which results in a score of 1 for Factor A. Additionally, the content is general and does not clarify the company's implementation status regarding any frameworks, leading to a score of 1 for Factor B.\n\n### Auditors & GRC Tools\nAuditors: Not Found\nGRC Tools:  Could not find\n\n### Criteria\nLocal:  Not Local\nJob Title: Limited Influence - Paralegal\nEmployee Count:Target Industry - Insurance\nIndustry: 500+ Employees\nIntent: ❌ No Match\n\n## Compliance Frameworks & Certifications\n- **Frameworks/Certifications that Nationwide\n has:**  \nNone Confirmed\n\n- **Auditors they used for compliance/certifications:**  \nNot Found\n\n- **GRC Tools they use:**  \nNot Found\n\n- **Research and Reasoning:**  \nAnalysis:  \n/aThe findings indicate a significant gap in available public documentation regarding specific compliance certifications for Nationwide. No definitive confirmation of certifications such as SOC 2, HIPAA, or others listed was discovered through various means. The emphasis on general compliance measures rather than concrete certifications could suggest a focus on operational compliance rather than formalized audits or assessments. Additionally, the lack of reference to specific auditors or GRC tools used by Nationwide indicates a potential absence of rigor in third-party compliance verification for the information available.\n\nReasoning:\nThe research found minimal specific data supporting Nationwide's compliance certifications or frameworks. There was an emphasis on general compliance procedures rather than confirmed achievements of industry-recognized certifications. Several searches returned limited or no relevant results. This indicates that while Nationwide demonstrates commitment to compliance, specific certifications may not have been verified or available to the public at this time.\n\n### Contact Info\nName: Robin Rice\nJob Title: \nPhone: \nEmail: ricer@nationwide.com\n\nLinkedIn: https://linkedin.com/in/robin-rice-4209647\nRecent Posts (If available): \n\n\n### Company Info\nCompany Name: Nationwide\n\nCity/State:  \nWebsite: https://www.nationwide.com\nIndustry: Insurance\nSpecialties: Insurance\nProducts: \n- Auto Insurance (motorcycle, classic car, ATV, RV, boat) - Home Insurance (homeowners, renters, condo, flood, business property) - Life Insurance (term life, whole life) - Pet Insurance - Umbrella Insurance - Identity Theft Protection - Travel Insurance - Business Insurance (businessowners policy, business auto, general liability, workers’ compensation) - Employee Benefits (retirement plans, group benefits) - Investment Products (personal retirement plans, annuities, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds)\nServices:\n- Auto Insurance - Home Insurance - Life Insurance - Pet Insurance - Umbrella Insurance - Identity Theft Protection - Travel Insurance - Business Insurance - Employee Benefits - Investment Products\n\n### ICP SCORING GUIDELINES\nTier 1: 50-65 points\nTier 2: 31-49 points\nTier 3: 20-30 points\n--\nFramework Score: \nFactor A: Page Type by URL Structure\n\nScore 3: Sales page visit (URL does not contain \"/blog/\")\nScore 1: Blog or informational page (URL contains \"/blog/\")\n\nFactor B: Framework Relevancy\n\nScore 3: Page EXCLUSIVELY about a framework the company has documented\nScore 2: Page EXCLUSIVELY about single framework company doesn't have (never use for government agencies)\nScore 1: Default score for:\n- Any government agency framework pages\n- Multiple frameworks mentioned\n- Framework implementation status unclear\n- General compliance topics\n- Any uncertainty about framework focus\n\n-- YOUR RESPONSE RULES -- \na) Using object provided generate and return prospect report in provided format\nb) Don't include anything else in your response\n\n`\n\nreturn {prompt: prompt}"},"type":"n8n-nodes-base.code","typeVersion":2,"position":[23900,2600],"id":"c98d1bb9-93a8-4b40-95ea-57fb4f618988","name":"AI Prospect report prompt"},{"parameters":{"promptType":"define","text":"={{ $json.prompt }}","options":{}},"type":"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent","typeVersion":1.7,"position":[24120,2600],"id":"61069b79-c0d0-4c0f-9a3d-e900a9647f2a","name":"Prospect Report - Agent","retryOnFail":true,"onError":"continueRegularOutput"},{"parameters":{"options":{}},"type":"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmChatOpenAi","typeVersion":1,"position":[24080,2800],"id":"ef60daf0-8072-412a-b4a2-1b835db7e8de","name":"OpenAI Chat Model","credentials":{"openAiApi":{"id":"mzHalaHzUD5jrTet","name":"searchactions.com: ispartnersllc.com - Website Visitor Enrichmen"}}},{"parameters":{"mode":"runOnceForEachItem","jsCode":"const original = $('Prospect Report').first().json\nconst output = $json?.output\nif(output){\n  original.prospect_reports.push(output)\n}\nreturn original"},"type":"n8n-nodes-base.code","typeVersion":2,"position":[24480,2600],"id":"727b5659-3cb4-4174-ae3a-afe65f239d79","name":"Prospect report response"},{"parameters":{"promptType":"define","text":"={{ $json.prompt }}","hasOutputParser":true,"options":{}},"type":"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent","typeVersion":1.7,"position":[21280,2600],"id":"d209d945-5d8e-4a40-a313-874d87d1ea77","name":"ICP Frameworks Agent","retryOnFail":true,"onError":"continueRegularOutput"},{"parameters":{"mode":"runOnceForEachItem","jsCode":"const prompt = `\n### INFORMATION\nOur marketing team has researched a company to identify if they currently hold any cybersecurity or IT compliance certifications or use any frameworks.

Consider the page the prospect visited first, then consider if there is a connection between the compliance framework of the page they visited and current compliance frameworks/certficiations held by ${input.company_info.name}.   Sometimes there will be two frameworks associated with a page.  In this situation, choose the framework that you believe the person is most interested in.  ${input.company_info.name};s current frameworks/certifications that they have, if they have any.  \n\n<OUTPUT>\nYour output will have two parts.   The first part will be the main framework you chose.   The second part will be the benefit sentence related to that framework.  Do not explain your answer or add any additional words to the output.    For example, if the framework/certification is SOC 1, your output will be:  Keep your clients' money safe, land those big company deals, and get your books in perfect shape.\n\nIf the page is about SOC 1 and SOC 2, and you are unable to choose the best framework, you can respond with the SOC 1 & 2 Benefits, which combine SOC 1 and SOC 2 benefits. \n\nIf you are unable to determine a framework/certification, then your output should be \"Unable to determine\" \n\nThe benefit sentence will be inserted into the \"benefit_sentence\" field.   The framework you choose will be inserted into the \"benefit_framework\" field. \n\nFor example, if HITRUST is the framework the person was interested in, then you would insert the \"Land bigger healthcare deals, nail multiple security checks at once, and make your security way simpler.\n\"  into the \"benefits_sentence\" field and \"HITRUST\" into the \"benefit_framework\".  \n\nFor example, if NIST AI RMF is the framework, then you will insert \"Get federal contracts rolling in, nail multiple security requirements, and stay ahead of new threats.\n\"  into the \"benefits_sentence\" field and \"NIST AI RMF\" into the \"benefit_framework\".  \n\n<IMPORTANT>\nDo not include the word \"Benefits\" in the \"benefit_framework\" output.  The \"benefit_framework\" will be the framework/certification.  It should not include the word \"benefits\".`\nreturn {prompt}"},"type":"n8n-nodes-base.code","typeVersion":2,"position":[27220,2560],"id":"f05bfac6-eac0-4a75-8221-a1fe91583245","name":"Single

Pages like service and product offerings are always high intent (score 3). Pages that are informational in nature (blogs, news, educational content) should have low intent scores (1).\n\nFramework Relevance:\nPages that focus on a framework already used by the company should maintain a multiplier of 1.0, reflecting strong relevance. Pages with multiple frameworks or no specific framework focus should have a lower multiplier of 0.8.\n\nConfidence Rating:\nThe confidence level will vary based on the clarity of the intent.

Computer Software industry, which has a focus on governance. The company is fairly large with 2,599 employees and possesses multiple compliance frameworks (ISO 27001, SOC 2). However, the lack of specific location data hampers the scoring in that category.

The contact hold a Registered Nurse position, reflecting a limited influence on compliance or IT security. The company meets HIPAA compliance and has SOC 1 certifications, indicating attention to security standards, but the contact's role is not aligned with decision-making in compliance or security areas. The interest shown by visiting a blog article suggests a desire for knowledge but lacks actionable intent towards specific frameworks.\n--Company CDW•G operates within the Information Technology & Services industry, with a significant employee base (5001-10000) indicating enterprise scale. They hold important compliance frameworks including NIST Cybersecurity Framework and potentially HITRUST.

The VP of Digital Commerce demonstrates strong influence over technology strategies but does not directly relate to compliance or security leadership. Crocs has two established compliance frameworks but visited a blog article indicating low intent.

PARTNERS\nI.S. Partners provides various IT compliance and audit services, including SOC 1, SOC 2, SOC 3, ISO 27001, PCI DSS, and other related certifications. They offer services such as readiness assessments, gap analysis, implementation support, and formal audits to help organizations achieve and maintain compliance with various security and data protection standards. For example, I.S. Partners will help companies achieve ISO-27001 certification or audit a company to ensure they are SOC 2 compliant. \n# IT AUDIT AND COMPLIANCE SERVICES\nHere are the IT audit and compliance services that I.S. Partners offers: \n**IT audit and compliance services**\n- SOC 1\n- SOC 2\n- SOC 3\n- SOC for Cybersecurity\n- SOC for Supply Chain\n- HIPAA/HITECH and HITRUST\n- PCI DSS\n- ISO Certifications (ISO 27001, ISO 42001, ISO 50001)\n- CMMC\n- CCPA and GDPR\n- GLBA\n- FISMA\n- MAR/SOX\n- MARS-E\n- NERC\n- NYDFS\n- Risk Assessments\n**Artificial Intelligence audit and compliance services**\n- NIST AI RMF\n- ISO 42001\n- HITRUST AI RMF\n**Cybersecurity audit and compliance services**\n- NIST CSF\n- SP 800-53\n- NIST Cybersecurity for IoT\n- NIST AI Risk Management (NIST AI RMF)\n# TARGET COMPANY \nCompany name: Ebay\nWebsite: ebay.com\nCompany LinkedIn:  linkedin.com/company/ebay\nIndustry:  ,E-commerce & Retail,Internet,Online Marketplaces,[object Object]\nSpecialities: \n# CLASSIFICATION GUIDE\n## COMPETITORS\nA competitor would be any company that provides IT compliance and audit services, including SOC 1, SOC 2, SOC 3, ISO 27001, PCI DSS, and other related certifications on the list below. They may offer services such as readiness assessments and gap analysis in addition to implementation support, and formal audits to help organizations achieve and maintain compliance with various security and data protection standards.\n### EXAMPLE - EXISTING COMPETITORS\nBelow is a list of companies that are competitors of I.S. Partners.  This is not a complete list - it is just a few of the thousands of potential competitors.  You can use this list to help you classify the target company as a competitor.   \n- Kirkpatrick Price: A cybersecurity and compliance audit firm specializing in SOC 1, SOC 2, PCI DSS, ISO 27001, and other IT compliance audits, offering a user-friendly platform and expert guidance throughout the audit process12.\n- A-lign: A cybersecurity and compliance solutions provider offering various audit and assessment services, including SOC, ISO, PCI, and HITRUST certifications.\n- Deloitte: A multinational professional services network providing audit, consulting, financial advisory, risk advisory, tax, and legal services across various industries.\n- BARR Advisory: A cloud-based security and compliance solutions provider specializing in cybersecurity consulting and compliance audits for various frameworks.\n- Prescient Security: A cybersecurity consulting firm offering security assessments, penetration testing, and compliance services.\n- RSI Security: A managed security services provider offering comprehensive cybersecurity solutions and compliance services for various industries and regulatory frameworks.\n- Schellman: A global independent security and privacy compliance assessor, providing various IT audit and certification services across multiple frameworks and standards.\n- KPMG: A multinational professional services network offering audit, tax, and advisory services, including IT compliance and cybersecurity solutions.\n- Ernst & Young (EY): A global professional services firm providing assurance, consulting, strategy, transactions, and tax services, including compliance and regulatory advisory services.\n- Hancock Askew & Co.: A regional accounting and advisory firm offering various services, including IT assurance and cybersecurity compliance audits.\n## PARTNERS\nCompanies that offer services and solutions like Cyber Insurance, Legal and Regulatory Consulting, Business Continuity Planning, Financial Auditing, Physical Security, Employee Training, Data Backup, Digital Forensics, Incident Response (DFIR), Managed IT Services, or Cloud Hosting and Infrastructure Services are potential partners. \nThese companies may provide services related to IT Compliance, but if IT compliance and audit services  (e.g., SOC 2 compliance, ISO certification, NIST certification, PCI DSS certification, HITRUST certification,etc.) are not their primary offering, they should be considered as potential partners.\nSpecifically:\n- If a company only provides IT compliance and audit readiness or preperation services, and does not provide the actual audit, they are potential partners. \n- If a company primarily sells these non-compliance services but does not specialize in IT Compliance audits or certifications, they could complement our offerings.\n- They could be a good partner for us in delivering comprehensive solutions where IT Compliance intersects with their services.\n - Such companies are probably not a competitor unless they position themselves as a specialist in IT compliance and audit frameworks like SOC 2 or ISO 27001.\n- Education, Government and Federal organizations are NOT to be considered as either competitors or partners.  You can identify Education organizations because their websites have the .edu domain extension.  Government and Federal organizations have websites and domains that end in .gov.  DO NOT CLASSIFY EDUCATION OR GOVERNMENT (LOCAL OR FEDERAL) ORGANIZATIONS AS COMPETITORS OR PARTNERS.\nIdentify companies as potential partners if they do not provide IT and cybersecurity compliance, certification, audits, and assessments as their core service or solution offering.\n### EXAMPLE - EXISTING PARTNERS\nHere are our existing partners.

Determine if the target company is an educational institution or government (local or federal) agency or organization.  If it is, do not progress to step 3.  Terminate the task. Government organizations/agencies can usually be identified by their website or domain, which has the .gov domain extension.  Educational institutions can be determined by their website or domain, which ends in .edu.\n2. Carefully analyze what the target company does - what services, solutions and products they sell or offer and describe it in one or two sentences.  \n3. Carefully compare the services and solutions that I.S. Partners provides to the those of the target company ( Ebay) and determine if the target company is a competitor.\n4. Carefully compare the services and solutions that I.S. Partners provides to the those of the target company ( Ebay) and determine if the target company is a potential partner.\n5. Make a clear determination of whether the target company is a competitor or I.S. Partners or a potential partner of I.S. Partners, or neither.  You will classify the target company based on the solutions and services they offer compared to I.S. Partners\n6. Explain your reasoning\n7. If a target company is neither a competitor or partner, do nothing.  \n8. You are judged on accuracy and not how many companies you identify as competitors or partners. \n# CRITICAL RULES\n1. If a company provides or sells an IT audit or compliance service that I.S. Partners offers, it is a competitor.  \n2. Only classify as PARTNER if you can confirm they don't perform competing services\n3. Focus on actual services offered, not just marketing language\n4. Government and federal agencies and organizations with websites that end in .gov are NOT competitors or partners. \n5. Companies that provide GRC software in a SaaS (Software as a Service) model are not typically competitors but partners. These companies provide software that helps organizations and auditors facilitate compliance audits or certifications. They typically do not provide the actual audit itself, so they would be considered partners. These companies include Drata, Vanta, SecureFrame, OneLogic, etc. \n6. A company may have achieved IT compliance or certification, but that does not influence if they are a partner or competitor.  For example, a target company may have achieved SOC 2 Compliance and mentions it on their website, but this has no influence on their standing as a potential partner or competitor.  Do not consider - or look for - if the company has achieved IT compliance or certification.  ONLY IF THEY PROVIDE SOLUTIONS TO OTHER COMPANIES TO HELP THEM ACHIEVE COMPLIANCE.  \n8. Only consider the IT compliance and audit solutions that I.S. Partners offers when considering if a target company is a potential partner or competitor.  Companies that offer compliance audits or certifications outside of what I.S. Partners offers are not in competition with I.S. Partners.\n# OUTPUT\nFormat your response in JSON\n{\n  \"type\": \"object\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"is_government\": {\n      \"type\": \"boolean\",\n      \"description\": \"\"\n    },\n    \"is_partner\": {\n      \"type\": \"boolean\",\n      \"description\": \"\"\n    },\n    \"is_competitor\": {\n      \"type\": \"boolean\",\n      \"description\": \"\"\n    },\n    \"confidence_level\": {\n      \"type\": \"string\",\n      \"description\": \"\"\n    },\n    \"services_offered\": {\n      \"type\": \"string\",\n      \"description\": \"\"\n    },\n    \"competitor_partner_reasoning\": {\n      \"type\": \"string\",\n      \"description\": \"\"\n    },\n    \"competitor_partner_confidence\": {\n      \"type\": \"string\",\n      \"description\": \"\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"is_government\",\n    \"is_partner\",\n    \"is_competitor\",\n    \"confidence_level\",\n    \"services_offered\",\n    \"competitor_partner_reasoning\",\n    \"competitor_partner_confidence\"\n  ]\n}\n# ACCURACY STATEMENT\nYour classification is critical.
